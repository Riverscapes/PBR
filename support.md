## Financial Support

Thanks to the generous support of the [Natural Resource Conservation Service's](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=steldevb1027671) [Sage Grouse Initiative](https://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/) and [Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/plantsanimals/fishwildlife/?cid=stelprdb1046975), a grant through [Pheasants Forever](https://www.pheasantsforever.org/) to  [Joe Wheaton's](http://joewheaton.org/) [ET-AL lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org/) at Utah State University. were able to build a restoration design manual for streams and riparian areas (i.e. riverscapes) that embraces process-based restoration, low-cost restoration techniques and a 'cheap and cheerful ethos'. This effort started as a design manual by the Wheaton ETAL group for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and the [Utah Watershed Restoration Initiative](). was envisioned by Jeremy Maestas (NRCS/SGI) and is possible thanks to partner matches by various local organizations in each state (see each state page) and matching funds from Utah State University.
