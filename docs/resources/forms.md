## Forms for you to use and adapt

We have created a wide variety of field forms for monitoring and design. These forms are available as Word documents *(üìù)* so you can modify them as you see fit for your purposes. We license all these with a [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) so you can adapt, distribute, and share them freely.
