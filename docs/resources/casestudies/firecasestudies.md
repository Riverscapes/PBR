The Harmony Preserve project uses process-based restoration â€” a low-tech approach that lets the Sprague, not construction equipment, do most of the work.

### Project Information

This was an emergency restoration project after the Bootleg Fire in summer 2021. Meetings with landowners, [USFWS](https://www.fws.gov/) and [Trout Unlimited](https://www.tu.org/) began in September 2021. Permitting and design were finished by November, and [Anabranch Solutions](https://www.anabranchsolutions.com/project-2021-46-bailey-flat.html) with [Swift Water Design](http://www.swiftwaterdesign.com/) finished construction by Thanksgiving.

## Baugh Creek, Idaho â†’ Sharps Fire 2018

The [Sharps Fire, 2018](https://www.fireweatheravalanche.org/wildfire/incident/50947/idaho/sharps-fire) was a key moment, coming on the heels of a [LTPBR Workshop](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/nrcs---idaho.html) in Hailey, Idaho.  

Terry Gregory (IDFG) had translocated live beaver for decades to Baugh Creek to help with restoration. Their dam-building led to a resilient stream corridor that withstood the fire remarkably well.
