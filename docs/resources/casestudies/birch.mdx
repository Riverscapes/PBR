# Intro to Birch Creek, Idaho & Jay Wilde

[![Birch Creek Virtual Field Trip](/img/pics/casestudies/BirchVirtualFieldTrip.png)](/resources/Topics/03_Planning/birchcreek)

[Birch Creek, Idaho](https://earth.app.goo.gl/n9RRA6) in southeast Idaho has become a poster-child case study for LTPBR. Birch Creek is a left-bank tributary to Mink Creek, which is tributary to the Bear River just downstream of Oneida Narrows.  

For a [virtual tour](/resources/Topics/03_Planning/birchcreek), meet landowner and rancher Jay Wilde, or see his talk further below.

**The goals of this project were to improve riverscape health and restore perennial flow.** The means to achieving this were reintroducing beaver and letting the process of *beaver dam activity* take over. As of Fall 2020, there are over 165 beaver dams in the creek now.

# Jay Wilde's Story: Reintroducing Beaver to Bring Back Perennial Flow

[![Jay Wilde](/img/people/Wilde_round.png)](https://earth.app.goo.gl/n9RRA6)

We have had the privilege of working with Idaho rancher Jay Wilde since 2014. For a more elaborate version of what [Joe explains here](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/Projects/birch/#part-1---why-we-can-even-work-in-birch-creek), it’s best to hear directly from Jay what happened. Jay tells his [story](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Workshops/CheapCheerful/2018/NRCS/Idaho/Lectures/2018_IdahoNRCS_Wilde_BirchCreek.pdf) about bringing beaver back to the creek he grew up on to restore flow.  

See Life on the Range's condensed version of Jay's story [here](https://youtu.be/gJYPEpv8X-c).

## Jay's Story - The Longer Version

Jay started going on the road in the summer of 2018 and helped spread this message to participants of SGI Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration Workshops. He’s now told his story to thousands of workshop participants across the American West.  

This video is from the [Logan Workshop](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/logan-workshop-materials.html):
