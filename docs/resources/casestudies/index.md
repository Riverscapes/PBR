# Case Studies of Low-Tech PBR

Case studies are critical for grounding the concepts in this [design manual](/manual/). As the list of case studies is always growing, we do not summarize them in a static chapter but instead refer the reader below to an annotated bibliography of case studies maintained on this website. Note most PDFs are available for download from [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Low-Tech-Process-Based-Restoration) for free if you create an account.

If you were part of or have completed a LTPBR project, please report it in the [LTPBR Explorer](http://bdaexplorer.com)!

The two case studies that gave LTPBR its initial credibility were:

1. [Bridge Creek IMW](/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module2#c-beaver-dam-analogues-bridge-creek--birch-creek), Oregon for BDAs  
2. [Asotin Creek IMW](/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module2#d-post-assisted-log-structures-case-study-asotin-creek), Washington for PALS

These are also covered in [Module 2](/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module2).

If you have a report on the planning, design, or evaluation of your own LTPBR case study and would like it added to the list below, [**Submit your Project as Case Study**](https://goo.gl/forms/Ol0FQsz9W4QoU4ME3).
