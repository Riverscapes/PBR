## Models

Through the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.xyz), a number of models have been developed to help scope, plan, design, and evaluate low-tech process-based restoration projects. These models are all open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Riverscapes) so you can use them for your own projects and assessments. They are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) so you can adapt, distribute, and share them freely.

- [**RCAT**](http://rcat.riverscapes.xyz) (Riparian Condition Assessment Tool): helpful for assessing riparian conditions, identifying the causes of departure from historic conditions, and evaluating recovery potential within the valley bottom.
