# Parking Lot Low-Tech Structure Building

[![Workshop Parking Lot](/img/pics/WorkshopParkLot.png)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dktnPpiQHcNyDjhGA)

As shown in the [pocket guide](/resources/pocket) on pages 55 and 56, we encourage you to experiment with building low-tech structures in a parking lot, park, or your driveway to get over any apprehension about building these for real. These simple exercises can:

- be great team-building
- simulate many of the safety and logistical concerns encountered
- get you familiar with the basics

Plus, the ingredients can be sourced from what you can find laying around or a quick trip to the local building supply store.

## Topic Covered in Virtual Workshop

In the 2020 Virtual Workshop, we presented this topic in [Module 1F: What You Came For - Your First BDA](/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1#f-what-you-came-for---your-first-bda).

# BDA Parking Lot Example

[![Pocket Guide BDA](/img/pics/PocketGuideBDA.png)](/resources/pocket)

The above figure shows the ingredients, tools, and instructions for a parking-lot version of the common post-line with willow wicker weave BDA (Figure 4.38 in [Chapter 4](/manual/chap04)).

Below is an example from two BDAs we built using a sidewalk as ‚Äúthe channel‚Äù and showing with ribbon the predicted zone of influence of the structures:

# PALS Parking Lot Example

The same can be done for PALS. Below is an example where Steve Bennett and Joe Wheaton built the first-ever parking lot PALS ‚Äî including:

- Two bank-attached PALS (one *bank blaster*, one *constriction jet*)  
- One mid-channel PALS  

using a sidewalk as ‚Äúthe channel‚Äù with ribbon showing the zone of influence:
