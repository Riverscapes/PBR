# Beaver Dam Activity Impacts on Fish

A review by Kemp et al. (2012) revealed that many perceived impacts of beaver dams on fish are based on conjecture and hearsay. This is not to say negative impacts never occur, but rather that biases among fish biologists and managers are common.

## Fish Passage

Beaver dams can temporarily or seasonally act as barriers to fish movement. Too often, this is assumed to be harmful. In fact, many native fish that co-evolved with beaver pass these dams easily, especially during higher flows that coincide with spawning. Moreover, the habitat diversity created by beaver dams can outweigh potential migration impacts.

## What Does Fish Passage Look Like?

Fish often use the mattresses in front of a dam to get over it:

Sometimes fish struggle, especially with breaches or unusual flows:

Jumping is not the most common way fish cross dams, but sometimes they do, as seen here:

# State Policies Regarding Fish Passage

## Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife

[![ODFW Guidelines](/img/covers/ODFW_FishPassageGuidelines.png)](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/passage/docs/Instream%20Restoration%20ODFW%20Fish%20Passage%20Policy%20Bulletin.pdf)

Oregon's fish passage law ([ORS 509.585](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/509.585)) initially posed challenges for LTPBR permits. In 2020, [ODFW](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/passage/) updated its [fish passage policy](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/passage/docs/Instream%20Restoration%20ODFW%20Fish%20Passage%20Policy%20Bulletin.pdf) to support LTPBR structures when they follow design guidelines in the [LTPBR manual](/manual).
