# Virtual Field Trip to Birch Creek

![Jay Wilde](https://docs.riverscapes.net/img/people/jay_wilde.png)

In our in-person workshops, we usually take participants into the field to visit an actual low-tech process-based restoration (LTPBR) project. Seeing a real riverscape suffering from “structural starvation,” and then observing a successful LTPBR restoration on the ground, helps you fully grasp what’s possible.

There is no substitute for meeting Jay Wilde in person and seeing what the beaver have done to [Birch Creek, Idaho](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/Projects/birch/) thanks to his efforts. Getting into the water and mud really makes these concepts click. This page recreates as much of that experience as possible through a virtual field trip.

## Where is this?

We begin at the Birch Creek Trailhead  
[7767 East Birch Creek Road, Preston, ID 83263](https://goo.gl/maps/BWc2nGndi6Fs1paZ6)

From there, the group travels up through Jay’s ranch and onto U.S. Forest Service land (FS Road 1054) to the Mill Hollow/Birch Creek confluence. If conditions are wet, high-clearance 4WD vehicles are recommended. It is about a 10–15 minute drive.

We then wander around Birch Creek and into Mill Hollow for a final wrap-up discussion.
