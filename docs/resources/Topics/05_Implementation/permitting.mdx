In the 2020 Virtual Workshop, the consultation and permitting process was covered in  
[**Module 5C â€” Consultation and Permitting**](/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module5#c-consultation--permitting).

## Utah LTPBR Permitting

The [Wild Utah Project](https://wildutahproject.org/stream-and-riparian-restoration) recently hosted a valuable webinar series featuring presentations from the Utah Division of Water Rights and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  

These webinars are especially useful for Utah practitioners to help ensure your project planning and permitting stays efficient and on schedule. Regulatory specialists explain **why a permit is required** and **what information is needed** to submit a complete permit application.
