# Adaptive Management

In the 2020 Virtual Workshop, adaptive management was introduced as a way to approach restoration in the face of uncertainty. This page expands on that theme and provides helpful resources.

## What is Adaptive Management?

[![Adaptive Management Loop](/img/pics/plan-amloop_1_orig.png)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289526568_Adapting_Adaptive_Management_for_Testing_the_Effectiveness_of_Stream_Restoration_An_Intensively_Monitored)  

Adaptive management is often described as **“learning by doing.”** More fundamentally, it provides a pathway to move forward in managing complex systems or projects even with uncertainty.  

A classic adaptive management loop has five elements:  

1. Planning  
2. Doing  
3. Evaluation  
4. Learning  
5. Adjusting as needed  

That adjustment step — revising models, plans, or actions based on what you learn — is at the heart of adaptive management.  

> *One hallmark of good adaptive management is proactively recognizing multiple possible responses to management actions, and building contingency plans to address them.*

## Adaptive Management That Is Pragmatic and Affordable

[![Adaptive Management in Fisheries](/img/pics/bouwes-am-fisheries.png)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289526568_Adapting_Adaptive_Management_for_Testing_the_Effectiveness_of_Stream_Restoration_An_Intensively_Monitored)

Bouwes et al. (2016) propose how adaptive management can shift from a tool for only the largest projects with the biggest budgets to something that is a **routine practice** on almost every restoration project.
