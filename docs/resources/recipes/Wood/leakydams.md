# Leaky Dams

In the UK, small leaky woody dams have become a common flood control practice (focusing on attenuation benefits). In fact, [Natural England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england) offers stewardship grants (see [RP32: Small Leaky Woody Dams](https://www.gov.uk/countryside-stewardship-grants/rp32-small-leaky-woody-dams)) of £401 to £500 per dam per year. 'Leaky Dams' are another example of inexpensive, low-tech, instream structures designed to emulate specific natural processes. 

With these types of structures, some practitioners and designers tend to focus a bit heavily on the *stability* of the structure itself. This is presumably because it is assumed that failure would be a bad thing, but in natural systems, woody debris jam "failures" and beaver dam "blowouts" are often associated with some of the most diverse habitats and most desirable features. That said, in systems that have ample sediment supplies, such leaky dams can be good at promoting structurally forced riffle features (Wheaton et al. 2015).
