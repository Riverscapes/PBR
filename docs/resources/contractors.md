## Need Help with Restoration Planning, Design & Implementation?

It can be overwhelming to know where to start with low-tech process-based restoration projects. The [workshops](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/about-workshops.html) taught through the [USU Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) are great for exposure, resources, and hands-on experience. However, sometimes it’s helpful to have a professional designer and planner with experience get you started.  

After receiving so many inquiries from practitioners, design manual authors [Joe Wheaton, Nick Bouwes, and Steve Bennett](http://www.anabranchsolutions.com/principals.html) started a consulting firm, [Anabranch Solutions](http://anabranchsolutions.com/), to help with these types of projects. [Get in touch with them](http://www.anabranchsolutions.com/contact.html) if you need help.  

Over time, more companies and firms will hopefully also start filling this niche. If you think your firm does, let us know, and we’d be happy to review your credentials and post a link here.

## Need Help with Nuisance Beaver Mitigation & Planning?

Nuisance beaver mitigation (so-called *living with beaver* strategies) are slightly more mature than the practice of beaver-assisted restoration. One of the best resources is the [Beaver Institute](https://www.beaverinstitute.org/), maintained by Mike Callahan. They maintain an ['Installer Locator' List](https://www.beaverinstitute.org/management/installer-locator/) for professionals.  

These companies also have relevant experience:
