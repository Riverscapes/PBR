## Quick Start

If you’re a seasoned webinar pro, just scan these essentials:

1. Attend any or all of the [five modules](/workshops/2020/SGI/#agenda). We **strongly recommend** everyone attend Module 1.  
2. Look for emails from [GoTo Webinar](https://support.goto.com/webinar/how-to-join-attendees), sent via the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM) and Laura Burchill. These emails include your join links. Log in **10 minutes early** to test your connection.  
3. Download or buy a hard copy of both the [LTPBR Manual and Pocket Guide](/workshops/2020/SGI/#workshop-textbooks) — we will reference these constantly.  
4. Check for [module materials](/workshops/2020/SGI/#course-materials) the day before each session. These include slides, handouts, and exercises.  
5. **Print out exercises and bring colored markers or pencils.** Modules 3 and 4 will have mapping exercises better done on paper.  
6. Expect **regular breaks**. Four days of webinars is a marathon. Stretch, move, and refresh when needed. We’ll announce breaks in each module.

## More Details

### What to Expect

Large virtual meetings can be imperfect, but we’ll keep them lively and engaging. With nearly 1000 live participants, one-on-one interaction is limited, but you can still engage through chat, Q&A, and polls.

**If you experience problems:**

- First, close the webinar and rejoin using the same link.
- If that fails, reboot your computer and rejoin.
- If you are still stuck, contact Laura Burchill:
  - Email: laura@aswm.org  
  - Phone: 207-892-3399
- Or catch up on [module materials](/workshops/2020/SGI/#course-materials) afterward.

**Don’t panic** — most issues resolve with a simple restart.

### Do I need to look and sound my best?

Nope!  
- Participants **will not** use their webcams or microphones.  
- Stay in your pajamas if you wish — no one will see you.  
- Instructors will share their voices, but also keep webcams off to reduce bandwidth strain.  

---

### How Will I Engage?

You’ll have **three main ways** to interact:  

- Respond to live polls  
- Ask questions in the webinar chat  
- Participate in the hands-on exercises  

Our moderators will collect questions and bring them up during panel Q&A. Not all questions can be answered live, but we’ll address the most relevant and common ones.

### What About Videos?

We will **avoid showing videos** live to protect lower-bandwidth participants. Instead, links to YouTube videos will be provided to view on your own.
