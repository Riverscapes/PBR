## Overview

Thanks to the generous support of the [Natural Resource Conservation Service's Working Lands for Wildlife](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/plantsanimals/fishwildlife/?cid=stelprdb1046975) and a grant through [Pheasants Forever](https://www.pheasantsforever.org/) to [Utah State University's Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) and [Joe Wheaton's ET-AL lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org/), we were able to deliver a free virtual workshop to NRCS conservationists and their partners. This series was envisioned by Jeremy Maestas (NRCS) and was made possible thanks to partner matches by various local organizations and matching funds from Utah State University. This workshop grew out of the successful 2016 Enhancing Mesic Habitat Resilience in Sagebrush Ecosystems Workshop and the 2018 and [2019](/workshops/2019/SGI/) series.

## Odd 2020 Opportunity

With COVID-19, the field workshop series was canceled. However, we adapted to offer a virtual version open to all! Thanks to NRCS’s Working Lands for Wildlife partnership, it was offered for free.

## Virtual Workshop Description

This virtual workshop introduced conservationists to *low-tech* process-based approaches for restoring streams and their associated riparian areas to benefit fish, wildlife, and working lands. Participants learned principles guiding low-tech process-based restoration and became familiar with Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS). Participants gained skills in planning, design, and implementation of projects.

We spread the curriculum over four days with breaks and self-paced exercises. All workshop materials, exercises, and presentations were made available for self-paced delivery, with the virtual gathering providing pacing and engagement.

## Workshop Textbooks

**Mandatory Texts:** A hard copy of both the manual and pocket guide was recommended, but free digital versions are available:

## More Background

Through [SGI 2.0](https://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/new-sage-grouse-strategy-unveiled-760-million-invested-2018/), NRCS is working with landowners and partners to protect and [restore mesic habitats](https://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/our-work/proactive-conservation/#section5).  

BDAs are increasingly popular bioengineering tools designed to mimic beaver activity to restore hydrologic function in incised channels. They have shown promise in achieving riparian goals cost-effectively.  

---

## Purpose & Need

There is a need to convene interdisciplinary staff to evaluate low-cost, low-risk techniques that can be scaled to meet mesic habitat restoration goals. Participants gained knowledge and skills needed to design and implement these practices.

## Audience

The virtual field workshop was aimed at anyone interested in improving riverscapes with low-tech PBR approaches: practitioners, land/resource managers, scientists, landowners, regulators, conservationists, and students.  

#### For Field Workshops

For field workshops, participation was generally by invitation, targeting NRCS staff and key partners with a cap of ~45 participants per site to keep exercises effective.

## Make it Count

![Restoration Consortium](/img/logos/restoration-paired-03-horizontal-blueonwhite.png)

Participation was free. However, participants could earn university credit or continuing education units through [Utah State University's Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu). Online courses were offered in Fall 2020, and participation in the virtual workshop could count toward those credits (with assessed assignments).
