## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:  

1. Develop *familiarity* with the core components of LTPBR design.  
2. *Understand* the difference between engineering-based design and LTPBR design.  
3. *Create* a complete low-tech PBR field design for an impaired riverscape.  
4. *Use* a **zone of influence** to communicate design hypotheses about structural forcing.  
5. *Assess* the expected uplift of a design phase and estimate a restoration timeline.
