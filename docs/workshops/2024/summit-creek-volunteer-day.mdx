# Summit Creek Volunteer Day

Join us **June 1, 2024** to improve riverscape health along Summit Creek in Smithfield, Utah by building beaver dam analogs (BDAs) and post-assisted log structures (PALS). Summit Creek is a left-bank tributary of the Bear River, meeting the Bear River just upstream of Cutler Reservoir. The project landowner is the United States Forest Service.
