## Workshop Dates

**May 9‚Äì10, 2024**

Hosted by the Nevada Association of Conservation Districts, US Fish & Wildlife Service, and the Nevada Conservation Districts Program, and taught by Anabranch Solutions. Workshop content was adapted from over 20 [LTPBR workshops](/workshops/) developed by Utah State University and the 2020 NRCS Working Lands for Wildlife [online modules](/workshops/2020/SGI/).

## Workshop Description

Participants learned *low-tech process-based restoration* (LTPBR) practices using simple, low-unit-cost structural additions (e.g., wood and beaver dams) in streams to mimic natural processes. The ‚Äúlet the system do the work‚Äù principle emphasizes working with nature, using hand-built, natural materials with short design lifespans to encourage natural recovery.
