# LTPBR Series Trainings for Federal Agencies

The [USU Restoration Consortium](https://restoration.usu.edu) has partnered with the [NRCS West National Technology Support Center](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/west-national-technology-support-center) and the [BLM Aquatic Resources Program](https://www.blm.gov/programs/aquatics) to create a standardized Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration (LTPBR) training series. These trainings will be incorporated into [AgLearn](https://aglearn.usda.gov/) and [DOI Talent](https://www.doi.gov/doitalent), and participants will receive CEUs and a professional transcript from Utah State University.

In **Spring 2024**, we are offering LTPBR Level I and Level II trainings. Delivery of Level III is planned for **Fall 2025**.
