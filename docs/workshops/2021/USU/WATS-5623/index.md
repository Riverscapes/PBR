## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Develop familiarity with the core components of the [LTPBR design process](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module4#d-design-standards-of-practice--designing-at-complex-scale).
2. Understand the difference between engineering-based design and LTPBR design.  
3. Create a complete LTPBR field design for a first-phase restoration of an impaired riverscape.  
4. Learn how to use a **zone of influence** to convey design hypotheses associated with structural forcing.  
5. Assess the degree of uplift of a proposed design (as a proportion of recovery potential) and estimate the phases and timeline to full recovery.
