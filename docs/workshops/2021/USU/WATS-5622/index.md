## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Differentiate** the collection & analysis phase of NRCS Conservation Planning from other phases, and recognize parallels to other restoration planning processes.  
2. **Explore** and read riverscapes to identify valley-bottom extents and structural forcing zones of influence.  
3. **Evaluate** current conditions of a riverscape and estimate a realistic recovery potential for LTPBR.  
4. **Recast** restoration objectives using realistic, S-M-A-R-T indicators (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound).
