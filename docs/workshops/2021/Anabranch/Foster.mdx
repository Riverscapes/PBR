## Taught for [Foster Creek Conservation District](https://www.fostercreekcd.org/)

**September 29 & 30, 2021 in Bridgeport, WA**

In this two-day workshop, you will be introduced to principles of healthy riverscapes and principles of riverscape restoration.

## Workshop Description

This field-based workshop in the Foster Creek watershed introduces resource managers, landowners, and conservation groups to low-tech process-based (LTPBR) approaches for restoring streams and their riparian areas. Participants will learn guiding principles, beaver ecology, and basic low-tech structures like Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS).  

Participants will receive free hard copies of the [Design Manual](/manual) and the [Pocket Guide](/resources/pocket). You are encouraged to review the [online lecture series](/resources/Topics/) ahead of the workshop.
