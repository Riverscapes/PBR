This publicly offered [short course](http://restoration.usu.edu/courses/LTPBR_Logan), hosted by the [Utah State University Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu), brought together partners interested in low-tech alternatives for restoring streams and associated riparian and mesic habitats to benefit wildlife and working lands. 

Over 2.5 days, participants were introduced to the principles underlying low-tech process-based restoration of riverscapes, including planning, design, and construction of cost-effective, low-risk techniques. Topics covered included partnering with beaver, beaver dam analogues (BDAs), post-assisted log structures (PALS), and other simple hand-built structures to facilitate process-based restoration.
