# 2019 Field Workshop Series

## Overview

Thanks to the generous support of the [Natural Resources Conservation Service's Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/plantsanimals/fishwildlife/?cid=stelprdb1046975) and the [Sage Grouse Initiative](https://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/), along with a grant through [Pheasants Forever](https://www.pheasantsforever.org/) to [Utah State University's Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu/) and [Joe Wheaton's ET-AL lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org/), this workshop series delivered field-based training across the West.  

This series was envisioned by Jeremy Maestas (NRCS/SGI) and was made possible thanks to partner matches by local organizations in each state, and support from Utah State University. The series builds on earlier efforts including the 2016 Enhancing Mesic Habitat Resilience Workshop and the 2018 series.

# More Background

Through [SGI 2.0](https://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/new-sage-grouse-strategy-unveiled-760-million-invested-2018/), NRCS has committed to working with landowners and partners to protect and restore mesic habitats like riparian areas and wet meadows to benefit sage-grouse.  

Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) have emerged as a low-cost, nature-inspired technique to mimic beaver activity and restore hydrologic and ecological processes in degraded channels. BDAs and other simple structures can promote riparian resilience at scales meaningful to working lands and wildlife.  

The workshop series was designed to bring together interdisciplinary staff to evaluate these low-cost, low-risk practices, examine restoration opportunities, and learn how to implement them to meet mesic habitat goals.

# Audience

This workshop series was intended for NRCS staff and key partners. NRCS states selected representatives engaged in mesic restoration, including biologists, engineers, and local specialists. States could also invite local partners supporting on-the-ground mesic conservation.  

Participation was invitation-only, with a cap of about 45 participants per workshop to keep hands-on activities effective. Participants could optionally earn 1.5 Continuing Education Units from [Utah State University](http://restoration.usu.edu) for $95.
