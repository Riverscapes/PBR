## FAQs CANVAS

These are common questions — especially for those new to the [Utah State University Continuing Education system](https://cpe.usu.edu/)— about accessing courses after registering for CEU credit.


### Class is starting and I just need to get on to Zoom link!

The most reliable way to access your class Zoom link is through your USU Canvas course page.

1. Log in to [Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com/)
2. Go to your dashboard and select your course
3. Click the `Zoom` link in the left sidebar
4. Open `Upcoming Meetings`

:::tip
The Zoom link stays the same for all sessions within a course, but differs between courses.

:::

In some cases, the Zoom link is also listed in the course [syllabus on this site](/workshops). If you don’t have your Canvas login handy, navigate to your course syllabus and look in the `Schedule` section.

### Are the class meetings recorded?
Yes. All class meetings are recorded and available to enrolled students through Canvas.

To access recordings:
- Log in to Canvas
- Open your course
- Select `Zoom` from the sidebar
- View recordings under `Cloud Recordings`

This is useful if you miss a class or want to review material.

:::warning
Recordings are only available to enrolled students and are not posted on this external website. Only lectures are available here.

### How do I access my course(s)?

All online courses registered through Utah State University are accessed via the [USU Canvas learning management system](https://usu.instructure.com/).

### I registred for CEU Credit through USU, but never got an email
By default, USU sends enrollment confirmation emails to your assigned university email address, which is your **A-Number@usu.edu**.


### What is my A-Number
Your A-Number is your unique USU student ID. It begins with the letter **A** followed by numbers (e.g., A01234567). You will need it to log in to Canvas and access course materials.

  }

### How do I change my Canvas notification email?
USU assigns your default Canvas email as **A-Number@usu.edu**, but you can add or change notification emails.

Follow [these instructions](https://community.instructure.com/en/kb/articles/662889-how-do-i-change-my-default-email-address-in-my-user-account).

### Canvas notifications

We recommend [adjusting your Canvas notification settings](https://community.instructure.com/en/kb/articles/662894-how-do-i-manage-my-canvas-notification-settings) to ensure you receive timely updates about announcements, due dates, and course activity.

## How the Online Classes are Delivered

This class and other classes in the LTPBR Series (except implementaiton build day for WATS/CEWA 5624) will use the same general format:

### Before class

Complete assigned tasks in Canvas Modules, including:
- Watching lectures
- Reading assigned materials
- Submitting any required assignments

### During class 
lass time focuses on discussion and application. Come prepared with questions, participate in discussions and breakout groups, and share insights from assignments or experience.

Posting questions to the [community forum](#community-resources) ahead of time helps us prepare to address them during class.


### Course planning and schedule
A high-level course outline is available at the bottom of the Canvas Syllabus page. All due dates are listed in the Canvas Calendar and within individual Modules.


### Resources
Required lectures are posted in each Module. Additional resources—including the LTPBR manual and pocket guide—are available via the Canvas Files page.


### Help and support
For most questions, please post to the [Community Forum](https://www.riverscapes.net/topics/38143/forum). Many questions are shared, and responses benefit everyone. The instructor and TA actively monitor the forum.

If your question is private or course-specific, contact the instructor via Canvas messaging. For technical issues related to Riverscapes Consortium software, visit [Support](https://riverscapes.freshdesk.com/support/home).
