## FAQs

### Class is starting and I just need to get on to Zoom link!

The most reliable way to access the Zoom link for your class is through the USU Canvas course page. Once you log in to [Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com/), navigate to your course dashboard, select your course, and look for the `Zoom` link in the sidebar menu. Then navigate to `Upcoming Meetings`.

The zoom link can also sometimes be found in the course [syllabus on this site](/workshops).

### Are the class meetings recorded?
Yes, all class meetings are recorded and made available to enrolled students through the USU Canvas course. You can access the recordings by logging into your Canvas account, navigating to your course, and looking for the `Zoom` section in the sidebar menu. There, you will find a list of recorded sessions under the `Cloud Recordings` session that you can watch at your convenience. This is handy if you missed class or want to review the material again.

Note that access to these course recordings is restricted to enrolled students only, and we do not post them to this external website (only the lectures are found on this site).



### I registred for CEU Credit through USU, but never got an email
By default, Utah State University (USU) sends course enrollment confirmation emails to the email address it creates for you, which is your A-Number@usu.edu. 

### What is my A-Number
https://cpe.usu.edu/contentManagement.do?method=load&code=CM000015
Your A-Number is your unique student identification number assigned by Utah State University (USU). It typically starts with the letter "A" followed by a series of digits (e.g., A01234567). You will need this number to log in to the USU Canvas system and access your course materials.

#### How do I change my default email address for USU Canvas notifications?

### Notifications from Canvas

You can customize how and when you receive notifications for various activities within your course.
