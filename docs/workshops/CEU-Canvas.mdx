## FAQs CANVAS
These are common questions (especially for those new to the [Utah State University Continuing Education system](https://cpe.usu.edu/)) that professionals have about accessing their courses after registering for CEU credit.

### Class is starting and I just need to get on to Zoom link!

The most reliable way to access the Zoom link for your class is through the USU Canvas course page. Once you log in to [Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com/), navigate to your course dashboard, select your course, and look for the `Zoom` link in the sidebar menu. Then navigate to `Upcoming Meetings`.

:::tip
The Zoom link will be the same for each session of the course, but differ between courses. 
:::

The zoom link can also sometimes be found in the course [syllabus on this site](/workshops), which may be your quickest bet if you don't have your Canvas login handy. Naivgate to the syllabus for your course and look for the Zoom link in the `Schedule` section.

#### Are the class meetings recorded?
Yes, all class meetings are recorded and made available to enrolled students through the USU Canvas course. You can access the recordings by logging into your Canvas account, navigating to your course, and looking for the `Zoom` section in the sidebar menu. There, you will find a list of recorded sessions under the `Cloud Recordings` session that you can watch at your convenience. This is handy if you missed class or want to review the material again.

:::warning
Note that access to these course recordings is restricted to enrolled students only, and we do not post them to this external website (only the lectures are found on this site).

### How do I access my course(s)?
If you are registered for an online course through Utah State University (USU), you will access your course through the [USU Canvas learning management system](https://usu.instructure.com/).

    toolUrl: "https://usu.instructure.com/",

  }  
  ]}

### I registred for CEU Credit through USU, but never got an email
By default, Utah State University (USU) sends course enrollment confirmation emails to the email address it creates for you, which is your A-Number@usu.edu. 

### What is my A-Number
Your A-Number is your unique student identification number assigned by Utah State University (USU). It typically starts with the letter "A" followed by a series of digits (e.g., A01234567). You will need this number to log in to the USU Canvas system and access your course materials.

### How do I change my default email address for USU Canvas?
Unfortunately, the default email address that USU assigns you is your A-Number@usu.edu email address. If you would like to change your default email address for USU Canvas notifications you can. Follow [these instructions](https://community.instructure.com/en/kb/articles/662889-how-do-i-change-my-default-email-address-in-my-user-account).

### Notifications from Canvas
For these courses, we recommend [adjusting your notification preferences](https://community.instructure.com/en/kb/articles/662894-how-do-i-manage-my-canvas-notification-settings) in Canvas to ensure you receive important updates about your course. You can customize how and when you receive notifications for various activities within your course.

## How the Online Classes are Delivered

This class and other classes in the LTPBR Series (except implementaiton build day for WATS/CEWA 5624) will use the same general format:

### Before class
Complete the following tasks as specified in each Canvas Module: Watch lectures, read assigned papers, and submitted any assignments due.

### During class 
We will have a discussion assuming you have already watched the assigned lectures and completed the reading. Come prepared with your questions. Participate in class discussions, exercises and break out groups, and present results from assignments/personal experiences. It helps if you post questions or comments to the [community forum](#community-resources) ahead of time so we can prepare to address them during class.

### What Are We Planning 
The general outline of the class is summarized at the bottom of the Canvas Syllabus Page. The due dates for all tasks are posted in the Canvas Calendar Page and within individual Canvas Modules Page.

### Resources 
The lectures you will need to review are all posted in each Module. All other resources, including the LTPBR manual and pocket-guide, are linked from the Canvas Files Page. 

### Help 
For most questions, please post them to the [Community Forum](https://www.riverscapes.net/topics/38143/forum). Anyone can answer posts, and myself and the TA will monitor the forum board and provide answers. We ask you to use the discussion board as many people have the same questions, and answers are often beneficial to everyone. If you have a question more specific or you would rather not post on the discussion board, feel free to contact the instructor via Canvas direct messaging. If you have a techncial question with Riverscapes Consortium Software, you can use our [Support](https://riverscapes.freshdesk.com/support/home).

## Community Resources
    These communities from the [Riverscapes Consortium](https://www.riverscapes.net/). These are great places to ask questions, connect with colleagues and share your work. We use these communities in lieu of Canvas discussion boards for class communication outside of class time. We use these communities as they connect you with the broader cohorts of students who have taken these classes (not just your current cohort), and they persist beyond the end of the course.
