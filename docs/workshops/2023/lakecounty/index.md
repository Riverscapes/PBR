# Overview

This workshop was developed by NRCS Oregon, Pheasants Forever, Blue Forest Conservation, Lake County Umbrella Watershed Council, Intermountain West Joint Venture, and Anabranch Solutions. Its goal is to equip local landowners and conservation professionals with training and support to implement process-based restoration at landscape scales.  

There is funding available for landowners and managers, and Pheasants Forever and Blue Forest are piloting new systems to further support the community’s goals of sustainable agriculture and landscape resilience.

## Workshop Description

Participants will learn about low-tech, process-based restoration approaches for streams and their associated riparian and meadow areas (“riverscapes”), to benefit grass production, water reliability, sustainable working lands, and fish and wildlife habitat.  

You will explore principles guiding low-tech restoration, and get hands-on experience with tools like Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS), designed to mimic key ecosystem processes.  

Content will blend lectures, discussions, and field exercises, supported by a published design manual.

## Audience

This workshop is intended for local conservation professionals, agency staff, landowners, and land managers.
