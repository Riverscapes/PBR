# Manhattan, KS Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration Field Workshop

**October 24–26, 2023**

Hosted by Ducks Unlimited, Kansas Alliance for Wetland & Streams, and Juniper Environmental, with support from the Natural Resource Conservation Service. Workshop content is based on more than 20 [LTPBR workshops](/workshops/) taught by Utah State University and supported by [2020 online modules](/workshops/2020/SGI/).

---

## Workshop Description

This workshop introduces participants to “low-tech” process-based approaches for restoring streams and their riparian areas (riverscapes) to benefit fish, wildlife, and working lands. Participants will learn principles behind low-tech process-based restoration and become familiar with hand-built structures including Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS). You’ll gain basic skills in planning, design, and implementation. The workshop includes lectures, discussions, exercises, and hands-on construction in the field on Day 3.
