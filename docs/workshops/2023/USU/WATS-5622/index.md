## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Differentiate the **collection & analysis phase** of the NRCS Conservation Planning Process and recognize similarities to other planning processes.
2. Explore riverscapes to identify valley bottom extents and the zones of influence for structural forcing.
3. Evaluate current conditions of a riverscape and estimate recovery potential using LTPBR.
4. Recast restoration objectives with S-M-A-R-T (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) indicators.
