## Catalog Description

This course introduces the implementation of Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration (LTPBR) of riverscapes. Students will build low-tech structures such as PALS (Post-Assisted Log Structures) and BDAs (Beaver Dam Analogues) on student-designed restoration projects. Students will also learn about consultation, permitting, construction safety, and logistics.
