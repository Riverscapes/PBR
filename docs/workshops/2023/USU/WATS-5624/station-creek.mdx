## About the Project

The WATS/CEWA 5624 Spring 2023 class was scheduled to focus on Station Creek, a left-bank tributary to the Bear River near Oneida Narrows and the Mink Creek confluence, on landowner Terry Westerberg's property. Inspired by the success of Jay Wilde’s beaver reintroduction on nearby Birch Creek, Terry hoped for similar improvements using a BDA-assisted beaver translocation approach funded by Pacificorp.
