## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:  

1. Develop familiarity with the [LTPBR design process](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module4#d-design-standards-of-practice--designing-at-complex-scale).  
2. Understand differences between engineering-based vs. LTPBR design processes.  
3. Create a complete low-tech PBR field design for a first-phase riverscape restoration.  
4. Learn how to use **zones of influence** to express design hypotheses associated with structural forcing.  
5. Assess the degree of uplift and estimate timeframes for achieving recovery potential.
