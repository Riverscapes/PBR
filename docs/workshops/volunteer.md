![Volunteer](/img/pics/volunteer.png)

For [USU-administered short courses and workshops](/workshops/uni/), we often allow and/or invite volunteers to participate in construction days and activities. To participate as a volunteer in construction, you need to:

- [A. Safety and Construction Background](#a-safety-and-construction-background)
  - [Implementation Logistics, Equipment \& Safety](#implementation-logistics-equipment--safety)
    - [Video](#video)

If you are a registered [matriculated student](/workshops/uni) or non-matriculated student registered for [continuing education units](/workshops/uni#professional-continuing-education-units), you do **not** need to separately register as a volunteer.

## A. Safety and Construction Background

Building BDAs and PALS is part of a Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration (LTPBR) technique that doesn't require extensive training or heavy equipment and therefore can be done by a diverse workforce. However, there are inherent risks in working outdoors in uneven terrain, with sharp tools, large woody materials, and a variety of equipment. These videos go over some of the safety issues to be aware of while participating in LTPBR projects.

### Implementation Logistics, Equipment & Safety

![Scott Shahverdian](/img/people/shahverdian-round_1.png)

[Scott Shahverdian](/workshops/2020/SGI/#instruction-team) details the logistics, equipment, and safety considerations of implementing a low-tech project. He talks specifically about post pounders and how to use them safely and effectively in riverscape settings, as well as staging materials for implementation.  

**Background:** This talk is based on [Chapter 6](/manual/chap06) of the design manual.
