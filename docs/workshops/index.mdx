    We have taught over 45 workshops, short-courses, and full semester-long classes since 2010 on low-tech process-based restoration (see table below). There are a variety of ways in which we have offered this training:

    - **[University courses](/workshops/uni)** through Utah State [University Department of Watershed Sciences](https://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/) for matriculated graduate students (e.g. WATS 5620, 5621, 5622, 5623, 5624, 5625, 6626, 6627,6628, 6629, 6900, 6860) or professionals as continuing education units (CEUs; e.g. CEWA 5620, 5621, 5622, 5623, 5624, 5625, 6626, 6627,6628, 6629, & 6900) — *tuition fee charged per unit*  
    - **Short courses & workshops** open to public enrollment administered through the Utah State University [Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) — *workshop fee charged*  
    - **Custom short course for a private audience** — Virtual Workshops (e.g. [WLFW 2020](/workshops/2020/SGI)) and In-Person Workshops *(paid for by workshop sponsor(s))*  
    - **[Self-Paced Modules](/resources/Topics/)** — *Free*
