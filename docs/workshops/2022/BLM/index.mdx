## Workshop Description

This workshop introduced BLM staff and partners to low-tech process-based restoration (LTPBR) principles for streams and riparian areas, including simple structures like Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS). Participants gained skills in planning, design, and implementation phases, supported by the published [Design Manual](/manual).  

Instruction combined lectures, discussions, hands-on classroom exercises, and field construction projects on [Pumpkin Creek](/workshops/2022/BLM/pumpkin).

## Audience

Target audience: Montana‚ÄìDakota BLM staff and their conservation partners working on riverscapes.  

When taught in the field, participation is typically capped to about 45, primarily BLM staff and key partners, to build local technical capacity across each state.
