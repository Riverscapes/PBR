## üåø Why Pumpkin Creek?

The [BLM Montana/Dakotas](https://www.blm.gov/montana-dakotas) is advancing LTPBR methods across its managed lands. Pumpkin Creek was chosen as a pilot site with support from [Utah State University](http://restoration.usu.edu) and the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.xyz).

Pumpkin Creek is a perennial prairie stream characterized by:

- low base flows  
- highly variable spring peak flows  
- reduced riparian vegetation from grazing  
- a lack of structural elements such as large wood or beaver dams  

> Without these features, the channel is deeply incised and geomorphically simplified.

# üìù Permitting

Learn about consultation and permitting in [Module 5](/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module5#c-consultation--permitting).

## NEPA Compliance

Federal projects require National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance through:

- [Categorical Exclusion (CATEX)](https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process#CATEX)  
- [Environmental Assessment (EA/FONSI)](https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process#ea)  
- [Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)](https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process#EIS)

BLM Montana-Dakotas developed a programmatic EA:

## Joint Stream Permitting (Montana DNRC)

Details and application forms:  
[Montana DNRC Stream Permitting](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/cardd/conservation-districts/the-310-law)

## Army Corps Section 404

In the Omaha District, more restrictive rules around wetlands sometimes increase costs. For Pumpkin Creek, [Amy Chadwick](https://www.greatwesteng.com/team-member/amy-chadwick/) prepared the joint permit package, including:
