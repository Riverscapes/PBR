## Description

This field-based workshop on Tepee Creek introduced conservationists to low-tech process-based restoration (LTPBR) methods for streams and their riparian areas. Participants learned principles of LTPBR, including simple hand-built structures like Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS). The focus was on restoration principles, design and construction of low-tech structures, and how to treat specific impairments. Planning, assessment, prioritization, and monitoring were not covered in detail but resources for deeper study are linked below.

We encourage participants to review [Module 1](/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1), the [Design Manual](/manual), the [Pocket Guide](/resources/pocket), and the [online lecture series](/resources/Topics/) before attending.

### Yakama Nation — Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT)

BRAT models the capacity of riverscapes to support beaver dams, assessing perennial flow, dam-building materials, stream gradient, flood resistance, and other key factors. It was run for Yakama Nation Reservation rivers, including parts of the Klickitat, Lower Yakima, Rock Creek, White Salmon, and Wind River watersheds.
