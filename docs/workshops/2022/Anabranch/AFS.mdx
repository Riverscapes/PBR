## Description

This half-day virtual workshop was presented as part of the American Fisheries Society Continuing Education Program at the Colorado/Wyoming annual meeting. It introduced resource managers, landowners, and conservation groups to low-tech process-based restoration (LTPBR) approaches for streams and riparian areas. The course is relevant even for those with some LTPBR knowledge, as instructors shared lessons learned from dozens of projects in multiple states. Participants explored guiding principles, beaver ecology, and types of low-tech structures (BDAs, PALS), focusing on construction and treating impairments. Specific examples related to fish population responses were presented.

## Resources & Course Materials

Because the course was online, it is helpful to review digital copies of the [Design Manual](/manual) and the [Pocket Guide](/resources/pocket). Participants are encouraged to review [Module 1](/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1) or Chapter 1 of the Design Manual before the workshop.
