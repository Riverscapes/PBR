## Catalog Description

This course introduces Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration of Riverscapes implementation. Students will construct low-tech structures like PALS (post-assisted log structures) and BDAs (beaver dam analogues) on student-designed restoration projects. Students explore consultation, permitting, and become proficient in construction safety and logistics.
