### Course Meeting Outline

Students will be expected to watch pre-recorded lectures and complete assigned readings before class. During class, group exercises and discussion will deepen understanding. Students will also take a virtual field trip and are encouraged to take a real field trip (self-guided).

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Differentiate** the collection & analysis phase of the NRCS Conservation Planning Process from other phases, and **recognize** its overlap with other restoration planning processes.
2. **Read** and interpret riverscapes to identify valley bottom extents and understand zones of influence of structural forcing.
3. **Evaluate** current conditions of a riverscape and **estimate** recovery potential using LTPBR.
4. **Recast** restoration objectives by articulating realistic, S-M-A-R-T (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) indicators.
