## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:

1. Develop familiarity with the core components of the [LTPBR design process](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module4#d-design-standards-of-practice--designing-at-complex-scale).
2. Understand the difference between engineering-based and LTPBR design processes.
3. Create a complete low-tech PBR field design for a first phase of restoration in an impaired riverscape.
4. Learn how to use a *zone of influence* to convey hypotheses associated with structural forcing.
5. Assess the degree of uplift for a design phase and estimate the timeline to achieve full recovery potential.
