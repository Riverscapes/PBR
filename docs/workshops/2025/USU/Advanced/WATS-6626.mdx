## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Use** [Riverscapes Studio](https://qris.riverscapes.net) to complete LTPBR Planning process for their own project.  
2. **Apply** concepts of Conservation Planning Process and LTPBR Planning taught in WATS/CEWA 5622, but with QRiS and quantiative mapping and analysis.  
3. **Read a riverscape** and document conditions using [Riverscapes Studio Protocols](https://qris.riverscapes.net/technical-reference/protocols/).  
4. **Analyze** current, estimated historic and potential future riverscape health conditions for their project riverscape.   
5. **Evaluate** risks and opportuntiies and produce a defensible plan of recovery potential for their site to inform LTPBR restoration design.  
6. **Create** a presentation and report of their findings, post draft project to the [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net), and if appropriate proposed actions to [PBR Explorer](https://pbr.riverscapes.net).
