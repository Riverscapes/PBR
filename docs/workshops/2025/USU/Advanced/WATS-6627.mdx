## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Use** [Riverscapes Studio](https://qris.riverscapes.net) to complete LTPBR Design process for their own project.  
2. **Apply** concepts of Conservation Planning Process and LTPBR Design taught in WATS/CEWA 5623, but with QRiS and quantiative mapping and analysis.  
3. **Articulate and support** "complex-scale" objectives  as part of design process appropriate to addressing condition impairments identified in planning phase.
4. **Design*** LTPBR treatments by specify locations and type of specific LTPBR structures and actions** - and use "structure-scale" zones of influence to articulate hypothesized short and meidum term responses.   
5. **Formulate** a design inclusive of construction, staging, and material sourcing logistics that account for risks and constraints identified in planning phase.
6. **Develop** expectations for short and medium term responses to proposed actions in this phase of their design, and articulate how much progress towards the recovery potential identified in their planning assessment they expect this treatment to potentially achieve. 
7. **Create** a full LTPBR design and report, post draft project to the [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net), and if appropriate share proposed actions on [PBR Explorer](https://pbr.riverscapes.net).
