# LTPBR Series Trainings for Federal Agencies

The [USU Restoration Consortium](https://restoration.usu.edu) has partnered with the [NRCS West National Technology Support Center](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/west-national-technology-support-center) and the [BLM Aquatic Resources Program](https://www.blm.gov/programs/aquatics) to develop a standardized Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration training series. These courses are pending incorporation into [AgLearn](https://aglearn.usda.gov/) and [DOI Talent](https://www.doi.gov/doitalent). Students will also receive continuing education units ([CEUs](https://cpe.usu.edu/contentManagement.do?method=load&code=PG0020)) and a professional transcript from Utah State University.  

In Spring 2025, we will offer the **LTPBR Level I and II** trainings. **Level III** will follow in Fall 2025.
