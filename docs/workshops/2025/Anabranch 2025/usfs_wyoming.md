# USFW Wyoming Assessment and Design Workshop

**June 23–27, 2025**

---

## Workshop Description

This workshop provides advanced instruction on riverscape assessment and the design of low-tech process-based restoration (LTPBR) for resource managers, landowners, and conservation groups. We will cover:

- Guiding principles of LTPBR
- Beaver ecology
- Construction and logistics for structures including BDAs (Beaver Dam Analogues) and PALS (Post-Assisted Log Structures)

**Focus areas include:**

- Asking the right assessment and design questions
- Managing uncertainty
- Implementing adaptive management
- GIS tools overview (no training, only a review)
- Updates from dozens of real-world LTPBR projects

**Recommended Pre-Workshop Review:**

- [Module 1](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1)
- Chapter 1 of the [Low-Tech Manual](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/)
