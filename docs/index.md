## Manual
[![cover image](/img/covers/Manual_Tilted_400.png)](/manual)

**The purpose of this [design manual](/manual) is to provide restoration practitioners with guidelines for implementing a subset of low-tech tools**â€”namely beaver dam analogues (BDAs) and post-assisted log structures (PALS)â€”for initiating process-based restoration in structurally-starved riverscapes. While the concept of process-based restoration in riverscapes has been advocated for at least two decades, details and specific examples on how to implement it remain sparse. Here, we describe â€˜**low-tech process-based restoration**â€™ (LT-PBR) as a practice of using simple, low unit-cost, structural additions (e.g. wood and beaver dams) to riverscapes to mimic functions and initiate specific processes. Hallmarks of this approach include:

- An explicit focus on the processes that a low-tech restoration intervention is meant to promote
- A conscious effort to use cost-effective, low-tech treatments (e.g. hand-built, natural materials, non-engineered, short-term design life-spans) because of the need to efficiently scale-up application. 
- â€˜Letting the system do the workâ€™ which defers critical decision making to riverscapes and natureâ€™s ecosystem engineers
