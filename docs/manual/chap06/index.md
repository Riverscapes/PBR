# Chapter 6: Low-Tech Restoration Project Implementation

[![Chapter 6 Cover](/img/covers/Chap6.png)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.25043.22567)

The [sixth chapter](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.25043.22567) is targeted at practitioners responsible for implementing low-tech process-based restoration projects. It focuses on the three primary components of implementation, covering:

- Consultation and Permitting  
- Construction  
  - Building Materials for Low-Tech Structures  
  - Tools & Equipment for Building Low-Tech Structures  
  - General Construction Guidance  
- Evaluation

Chapter 6 also has appendices on:  
- Appendix A: Post Driver Information  
- Appendix B: Wood Replenishment with Griphoists

## Implications for Practice

- Key phases of restoration project implementation include obtaining regulatory consultations and permits, construction, monitoring, and adaptive management.  
- The application of beaver dam analogues (BDAs) and post-assisted log structures (PALS) as low-tech tools for process-based restoration is an emerging approach. Practitioners may need to work closely with local regulators to increase awareness of the practice and expected outcomes.

---

- Unlike traditional restoration practices, where construction is generally performed by specialized contractors or heavy equipment operators, low-tech structures are often hand-crafted and can be built by a much broader range of practitioners (e.g., volunteers, conservation corps, professionals).  
  - This allows greater community involvement, but does require additional safety and logistical considerations.
