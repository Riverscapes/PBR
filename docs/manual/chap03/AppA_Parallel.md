# Parallels Between Different Planning Frameworks for Restoration

Table 1 from Bennett et al. (2019) — Nine planning steps, associated planning concepts, and adaptive management steps for planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating a restoration project. Adapted from [NRCS (2007)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/water/manage/restoration/?cid=stelprdb1044707), [Yochum (2016)](https://riversedgewest.org/sites/default/files/resource-center-documents/yochumusfs-nsaec-tn102-2gudncstrmrstrtnrhbltn.pdf), [Skidmore et al. (2011)](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/4020), and [Bouwes et al. (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289526568_Adapting_Adaptive_Management_for_Testing_the_Effectiveness_of_Stream_Restoration_An_Intensively_Monitored).

| Planning Step | Planning Concepts | Adaptive Management Step & Actions | Riverscape Design Manual Chapter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Identify Overall Management Goals, Problems & Opportunities** | - Identify management goals and setting  <br /> - Identify causes of impairment and related processes  <br /> - Look upstream/downstream and address watershed issues before reach-scale issues  <br /> - Don’t assume the stream needs to be “fixed” (erosion and migration are natural) | **Plan** | Chapters [1](/manual/chap01), [2](/manual/chap02), [3](/manual/chap03) |
| **2. Determine Initial Objectives** | - Identify causes of impairment and processes | **Plan**  <br /> - Develop initial objectives | Chapters [1](/manual/chap01), [2](/manual/chap02), [3](/manual/chap03) |
| **3 & 4. Inventory and Analyze Resources** | - Synthesis of previous assessments and planning efforts  <br /> - Embrace uncertainty as an asset | **Plan**  <br /> - Review past assessments  <br /> - Develop conceptual models of riverscape function | [Chapter 3](/manual/chap03) |
| **5 & 6. Formulate and Evaluate Alternatives** | - Question constraints and remove rather than introduce new ones  <br /> - Evaluate alternative strategies | **Plan**  <br /> - Determine and evaluate restoration actions  <br /> - Test conceptual models | [Chapter 3](/manual/chap03) |
| **7. Make Decisions & Select Restoration Action** | - Design resilient projects to protect investments in the future | **Plan**  <br /> - Develop monitoring plan, benchmarks (triggers) for maintenance and addressing risk | Chapters [3](/manual/chap03), [6](/manual/chap06) |
| **8. Implement the Plan** | - Maximize natural processes  <br /> - Do no lasting harm | **Do**  <br /> - Implement monitoring plan (including pre-project data)  <br /> - Implement low-tech restoration | Chapters [4](/manual/chap04), [5](/manual/chap05), [6](/manual/chap06) |
| **9. Evaluate the Plan** | - Follow up and learn  <br /> - Adapt to increase project efficiency | **Evaluate, Learn, Adjust**  <br /> - Evaluate monitoring data, update conceptual models and monitoring plans as needed, and maintain structures as needed | [Chapter 6](/manual/chap06) |
