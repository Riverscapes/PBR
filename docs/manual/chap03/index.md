[![Chapter 3 Cover](/img/covers/Chap3.png)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.15815.75680)

The [third chapter](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.15815.75680) covers planning for low-tech process-based restoration. It illustrates the process with the [NRCS Conservation Planning Process](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/technical/cp/) and shows what aspects are distinctive to low-tech restoration. Specifically, it covers:

- Where to Plan?  
- Phase 1: Collection & Analysis  
- Phase 2: Decision Support & Design  
- Phase 3: Application & Evaluation  
- The Low-Tech Extension of the Conservation Planning Process

Chapter 3 also has appendices on:

- [Appendix 3A: Parallels Between Different Planning Frameworks for Restoration](/manual/chap03/AppA_Parallel)  
- Appendix 3B: Mapping Synthesis of Problems & Opportunities  
- Appendix 3C: Mapping Valley Bottom for Assessing Space  
- Appendix 3D: Assessing Risk to Property, Infrastructure, and Public Safety  
- Appendix 3E: Assessing Riparian Conditions to Support Wood Accumulation  
- [Appendix 3F: Assessing Potential for Beaver Dam Activity](/manual/chap03/AppF_BRAT)  
- Appendix 3G: Structure Level Adaptive Management

## Implications for Practice

![Planning Adaptive Management Diagram](/img/diagrams/Plan_AM_250.png)

- Planning for low-tech process-based restoration is similar to other restoration planning.  
- The Conservation Planning Process is adapted to highlight what is unique about low-tech restoration. It follows an adaptive management framework with three phases:  
  1. Collection and Analysis  
  2. Decision Support and Design  
  3. Application and Evaluation  
- For low-tech restoration, four screening questions are posed during the process to identify where low-tech process-based restoration may not be appropriate.  
- From the Collection and Analysis Phase, valley bottom conditions, constraints, and recovery potential are identified to frame treatments and design targets.  
- Low-tech restoration to reverse structural starvation of riverscapes often requires more than one treatment. Expectations for restoration progress are set during design, and the number of treatments required is discussed.  
- Implementation involves iteratively carrying out structural additions and evaluation. Ultimately, the goal is that wood accumulation and beaver dam activity will transition from *mimicked* and *promoted* to self-sustaining. At that point, the project can be considered successful.

## Planning Distilled

[![NRCS Conservation Planning Process](/img/nrcseprd.png)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/technical/cp/)

These slides walk through a standardized Conservation Planning Process from [NRCS (2007)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/water/manage/restoration/?cid=stelprdb1044707) and how it differs for low-tech process-based restoration.
