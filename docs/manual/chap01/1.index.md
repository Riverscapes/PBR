## Chapter 1: Background & Purpose

[![Chapter 1 Cover](/img/covers/Chap1.png)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.14138.03529)

The first chapter lays out the purpose and organization of the manual. It also covers the background necessary to understand low-tech process-based restoration. Specifically, the following topics are covered:

- Scope of Degradation
- Structurally-Starved Riverscapes
- Riverscapes States and Conditions
- A Review of Restoration

Chapter 1 also has appendices on:

- [Appendix A](/manual/chap01/appendix-A): Partial Selection of Past Literature Relevant to Low-Tech Restoration
- Appendix B: Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration Semantics
- Appendix C: Existing Low-Tech Practices
- Appendix D: Nothing is Really New
- [Appendix E](/manual/chap01/appendix-E): River Health Analogy

## Implications for Practice

**Key Points:**

- Riverscapes are composed of connected floodplain and channel habitats that together make up the valley bottom.
- The scope of degradation of riverscapes is massive. Tens of thousands of miles of riverscapes are in poor or fair condition.
- Structural-starvation is both a direct cause of degradation, as well as a consequence of land use changes and direct modification of stream and riparian areas.
- Engineering-based restoration tends to emphasize channel form and stability, rather than promoting the processes that create and maintain healthy riverscapes, which leads to increased costs and a limited ability to restore more miles of riverscapes.

**Principles of Process-Based Restoration:**

- Process-based restoration focuses on restoring physical processes that lead to healthy riverscapes.
- Low-cost, simple, hand-built structures have been used for over a century. Restoration principles are needed to guide the use of low-tech structures in order to address the scope of degradation, which will require that practitioners “let the system do the work.”
- The overarching goal of low-tech restoration is to improve the health of as many miles of riverscapes as possible and to promote and maintain the full range of self-sustaining riverscape processes.
