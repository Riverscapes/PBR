## Chapter 5: Designing Low-Tech Restoration Projects

[![Chapter 5 Cover](/img/covers/Chap5.png)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11621.45286)

The [fifth chapter](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11621.45286) covers the low-tech process-based restoration design process. This process is generic to designing any type of low-tech process-based restoration treatment (not just [PALS & BDAs](/manual/chap04)). Specifically, it covers:

- Key Principles for Designing Low-Tech Restoration Projects  
- Getting Started ‚Äì Design and Required Information  
- A Low-Tech Design Plan  
- Design of a Complex  
- Considerations for Common Complex Objectives  
- The Importance of Time and Flow Conditions

Chapter 5 also has an appendix on:  
- Appendix A: The Topographic Paradox

## Implications for Practice

**Key Takeaways:**

- A *complex* is a group of structures designed to work together to mimic and promote specific processes to meet project objectives. Complexes are the building blocks of a low-tech restoration design.  
- The low-tech restoration design process for complexes:  
  - is rapid, low-cost, flexible, transparent, field-based, and generates clear and testable design hypotheses;  
  - hypothesizes the hydraulic zone of influence (laterally constrained by the valley bottom), helping set expectations for treatment impact relative to project goals and reach objectives for recovery potential;  
  - identifies low-flow, typical-flood, and extreme-flood hypotheses (process-based responses) to articulate the connection between processes initially mimicked, later promoted, and eventually sustained naturally by the system.

- Design of low-tech restoration projects focuses on the **complex-scale** rather than individual structures to better address riverscape structural starvation.  
- Complexes typically include between 2‚Äì15 structures, and their objectives may differ or align depending on project goals and reach recovery.  
- Learning, innovation, and refinement of design improve when clear, testable hypotheses are defined at the complex-scale.
