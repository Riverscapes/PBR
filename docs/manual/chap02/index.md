## Implications for Practice

**Key Points:**

- Low-tech process-based restoration principles are critical as a basis for applying low-tech treatments and for managing expectations about timing and outcomes.  
- These principles help practitioners tackle low-tech restoration of structurally-starved riverscapes, though many could apply more broadly.  
- Guiding principles fall into two categories:  
  - **Riverscapes Principles** – describing what constitutes healthy riverscapes to define restoration goals  
  - **Restoration Principles** – influencing how to plan, design, and implement restoration  
- Since this manual focuses on structurally-starved riverscapes, principles emphasizing processes like wood accumulation and beaver dam activity are highlighted.
