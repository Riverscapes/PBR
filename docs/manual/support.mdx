## Financial Support

This design manual was made possible with financial support from the [USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Serviceâ€™s Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=steldevb1027671) through [Pheasants Forever](https://www.pheasantsforever.org/) (USU Award: 201426), the [Utah Watershed Restoration Initiative](https://wri.utah.gov/) through the [Utah Division of Wildlife Resources](https://wildlife.utah.gov/) (USU Award: 130942, 150102, 200225, 200896), the [Bureau of Land Management](http://blm.gov) (USU Award: 201284), and [Anabranch Solutions](http://anabranchsolutions.com). Kent "Sorno" Sorenson ([UDWR](https://wildlife.utah.gov/)) and Tyler Thompson ([WRI](https://wri.utah.gov/)) provided the original support and have been extremely patient. Jeremy Maestas ([NRCS](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov)/[SGI](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=steldevb1027671)) had the vision for what the manual could be and was persistent and patient in pushing to see its completion.
