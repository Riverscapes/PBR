The Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration of Riverscapes Design Manual is organized into a series of chapters, each with its own page(s). Each chapter has its own citation and DOI, so that it is citable individually and can be updated and re-published without the entire design manual being re-issued. The recommended citation for the entire manual is:
