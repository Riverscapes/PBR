## Chapter 4: Mimicking and Promoting Wood Accumulation and Beaver Dam Activity with Post-Assisted Log Structures and Beaver Dam Analogues

[![Chapter 4 Cover](/img/covers/Chap4.png)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22526.64324)

The [fourth chapter](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22526.64324) is meant to be the authoritative reference on two low-tech restoration techniques that are lacking guidelines in the literature: **post-assisted log structures (PALS)** and **beaver dam analogues (BDAs)**. It helps readers understand what PALS and BDAs are, how they are used in [low-tech restoration design](/manual/chap05), and focuses on the processes initially *mimicked*, later *promoted*, and eventually *self-sustaining* ‚Äî namely **wood accumulation** and **beaver dam activity**.

Chapter 4 also has appendices on:  
- Appendix A: Frequently Asked Questions About PALS and BDAs  
- Appendix B: Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration Semantics  
- [Appendix C](#chapter-four-figures): Recent History of Beaver Dam Analogues  
- [Appendix D](#chapter-four-figures): Typical Schematics and General Suggestions for Placement and Construction of PALS  
- [Appendix E](#chapter-four-figures): Typical Schematics and General Suggestions for Placement and Construction of BDAs

## Implications for Practice

![PALS Example](/img/diagrams/PALS_BA_XS_Blaster_250.png)

- Post-assisted log structures (PALS) and beaver dam analogues (BDAs) are hand-built structures.  
- PALS mimic and promote the processes of wood accumulation; BDAs mimic and promote beaver dam activity.  
- PALS and BDAs are permeable, temporary structures, built using natural materials.  
- BDAs create ponds with various fill materials; PALS use only woody material, usually of larger diameter.

![BDA Example](/img/diagrams/BDA_Postless_Profile_250.png)

- PALS and BDAs address structural starvation in wadeable streams, but can also help with more specific impairments.  
- They can be built in various shapes, sizes, and orientations using local materials.  
- Best results come from building many structures, increasing complexity.  
- Some PALS or BDAs may breach or lose material, but this material usually gets trapped downstream, increasing diversity.
