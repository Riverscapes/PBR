 <strong>The purpose of this [design manual](/manual) is to provide restoration practitioners with guidelines for implementing a subset of low-tech tools</strong> â€” namely beaver dam analogues (BDAs) and post-assisted log structures (PALS)â€”for initiating process-based restoration in structurally-starved riverscapes. While the concept of process-based restoration in riverscapes has been advocated for at least two decades, details and specific examples on how to implement it remain sparse. Here, we describe <strong>low-tech process-based restoration</strong> (LT-PBR) as a practice of using simple, low unit-cost, structural additions (e.g. wood and beaver dams) to riverscapes to mimic functions and initiate specific processes. Hallmarks of this approach include:

<ul>
  <li>An explicit focus on the processes that a low-tech restoration intervention is meant to promote</li>
  <li>A conscious effort to use cost-effective, low-tech treatments (e.g. hand-built, natural materials, non-engineered, short-term design life-spans) because of the need to efficiently scale-up application.</li>
  <li>'Letting the system do the work' which defers critical decision making to riverscapes and nature's ecosystem engineers</li>
</ul>

The [design manual](/manual) and  [Pocket Guide](/resources/pocket) are available digitally for free thanks to the generous investments and support from our [sponsors](/manual/support). Moreover, after the [virtual training in August 2020](/workshops/2020/SGI/#course-materials), all the [introductory workshop modules](/workshops/2020/SGI/#course-materials) are now available free [here](/workshops/2020/SGI/#course-materials) for self-paced learning.
