# Utah State University Administered Courses

In Spring 2021, we began offering a sequence of five, short-courses, that parallel the modularized workshop curriculum (available for free, self-pacing [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/Topics/ )). These short-courses differ from the workshop curriculum in that:
- These courses are taken for University Credit (for matriculated USU students) or University [Continuing Education Units](https://www.usu.edu/ais/ceu/about)
- These courses use the same curriculum, but are augmented by more in-depth class discussions, quizzes and homework assignments
- These courses are assessed, and you will receive feedback and a letter grade based on your assessed work.

The  LTBPR Spring Series of courses meet weekly on Tuesdays from 13:30 to 15:30  ([hybrid F2F](https://www.usu.edu/ais/scheduling/deliverymethods)), and the Design and Implementation have mandatory Saturday Field Trips in addition (see [Spring 2021 for dates]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshops/2021/USU/)).

# Make it Count

Through our [USU Restoration Consoritum](http://restoration.usu.edu/) we  offer professional CEU credit hours as well as undergraduate or graduate matriculated student regular credit hours through the USU registrar. To earn these credits, one needs to both pay the [regular tuition](https://www.usu.edu/registrar/registration/payment/) and submit assignments, which are formally asssessed. By contrast, if you just want a Certificate of Participation (suffices for some professional development and training requirements), we issue these at participant request for all our workshops.  


## Professional Continuing Education Units
Our University offers professional continuing education units ([CEUs](https://www.usu.edu/ais/ceu/about)) where 1 CEU is roughly 10 contact hours). These are available through the CEWA (Continueing Education WAtershed) course prefix and include special topics (CEWA 5700) as well as the Low-Tech Series (CEWA 5620-5624) .


## CERP - Compliant
Our program and the LTPBR curriculum are undergoing a review by the Society of Ecological Restoration so that  these courses will count towards their [Certified Ecological Restoration Practitioner Program](https://www.ser.org/page/Certification).
