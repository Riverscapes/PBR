# Utah State University Administered Courses

In Spring 2021, we began offering a sequence of five, short-courses, that parallel the modularized workshop curriculum (available for free, self-pacing [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/Topics/ )). These short-courses differ from the workshop curriculum in that:
- These courses are taken for University Credit (for matriculated USU students) or University [Continuing Education Units](https://www.usu.edu/ais/ceu/about)
- These courses use the same curriculum as the [free self-paced modules](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/Topics/), but are augmented by more in-depth class discussions, quizzes and homework assignments
- These courses are assessed, and you will receive feedback and a letter grade based on your assessed work.

The  LTBPR Spring Series of courses meet weekly on Tuesdays from 13:30 to 15:30  ([hybrid F2F](https://www.usu.edu/ais/scheduling/deliverymethods)), and the Design and Implementation have mandatory Saturday Field Trips in addition (see [Spring 2021 for dates]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshops/2021/USU/)).

# Make it Count

Through our [USU Restoration Consoritum](http://restoration.usu.edu/) we  offer professional CEU credit hours as well as undergraduate or graduate matriculated student regular credit hours through the USU registrar. To earn these credits, one needs to both pay the [regular tuition](https://www.usu.edu/registrar/registration/payment/) and submit assignments, which are formally assessed. By contrast, if you just want a Certificate of Participation (suffices for some professional development and training requirements), we issue these at participant request for all our workshops.

## Professional Continuing Education Units

Our University offers professional continuing education units ([CEUs](https://www.usu.edu/ais/ceu/about)) where 1 CEU is roughly 10 contact hours). These are available through the CEWA (Continuing Education Watershed) course prefix and include special topics (CEWA 5700) as well as the Low-Tech Series (CEWA 5620-5624) .

### Make sure you have an A Number

In order to register for CEU classes using a CRN (course registration number) and [Banner](https://it.usu.edu/banner/), you need to first have an [A Number with USU](https://www.usu.edu/registrar/help/faq/banner/i-cant-find-my-anumber) (this will get you an account and access to [Canvas](http://canvas.usu.edu) and other University Systems). If you have taken courses in the past at USU, you should have an A Number (check [here](https://www.usu.edu/registrar/help/faq/banner/i-cant-find-my-anumber) if you can't find it). Your A Number is managed in [https://myid.usu.edu](https://myid.usu.edu/?_ga=2.245608524.997753614.1612541789-2075134736.1603320200). 

####  Non-degree Seeking Student Application
If you do not have A Number, you can obtain one by applying as a Non-Degree Seeking Student. You can fill in the application [here](https://www.usu.edu/admissions/apply/). It takes about 10 minutes to complete.

## CERP - Compliant
Our program and the LTPBR curriculum are undergoing a review by the Society of Ecological Restoration so that  these courses will count towards their [Certified Ecological Restoration Practitioner Program](https://www.ser.org/page/Certification).
