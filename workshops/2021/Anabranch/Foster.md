## Taught for [Foster Creek Conservation District](https://www.fostercreekcd.org/)

**September 29 & 30,  2021 in Bridgeport, WA**

In this 2 day workshop, you will be introduced to  principles of a healthy riverscapes and principles of riverscape restoration.

-----
## Description
This two-day field-based workshop will take place in the Foster Creek watershed near Bridgeport, WA and is intended to introduce resource managers, land-owners, and conservation groups to ‘low-tech’ process-based (LTPBR) approaches for restoring streams and their associated riparian areas (riverscapes) to benefit fish, wildlife, and working lands. Participants will learn principles guiding low-tech process-based restoration, become familiar with basic beaver ecology, and different types of low-tech structures, including Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS). The focus of the workshop will be on the guiding principles, the construction of different low-tech structures, and the impairments the structures can treat. Aspects of low-tech planning, assessment, design, and permitting will not be discussed in detail. 


Because the course will be taught in the field, it will be helpful to refer to some documents. We will have hard copies of the [Design Manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual) and the [Pocket Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/pocket), available for workshop participants at no cost. An [online lecture seasons]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/Topics/)   can be viewed either as videos or pdf documents.  We encourage workshop participants to review some of the lecture material before the workshop. We will update the website with pictures and other information after the workshop.

## Course Materials


### Workshop Textbooks
For the workshops, we will rely on the new [Design Manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual) and the [Pocket Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/pocket), which are both available free digitally.   A hard copy of both will be provided to you in person at the workshop.  


### Workshop Lectures
Thanks to the generous support of the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s Working Lands for Wildlife, and a grant through Pheasants Forever to Utah State University’s Restoration Consortium and Joe Wheaton’s ET-AL lab are able to deliver a free virtual workshops to NRCS conservationists and their partners. This series was envisioned by Jeremy Maestas (NRCS) and is possible thanks to partner matches by various local organizations in each state and matching funds from Utah State University. This grew out of the successful 2016 Enhancing Mesic Habitat Resilience in Sagebrush Ecosystems Workshop at Utah State University and the 2018 and 2019 workshop series.

The latest iteration of these is a lecture series designed to be presented virtually over five days. The link below provides access to all the lectures on each aspect of low-tech PBR (e.g., planning and assessment, design, implementation)  in video and pdf format. These resources will provide more detailed information and links to scientific literature than can be delivered in field-based format.
