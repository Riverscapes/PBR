# USFW Wyoming Unlimited Assessment and Design Workshop 



**June 23-27, 2025**

-----
## Description
The workshop is intended to provide more advanced instruction related to riverscape assessment and design of low-
tech’ process-based restoration (LTPBR) for resource managers, land-owners, and conservation groups. We will
review principles guiding low-tech process-based restoration, beaver ecology, and construction and logistics
approaches for low-tech structures, including Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures
(PALS).
However, the focus of the workshop will be on gaining a greater understanding of the questions to ask during the
assessment and design processes, how to identify and manage uncertainty, and how to implement projects in an
adaptive management framework to maximize “learning by doing”. There will be a review of potential GIS tools to
assist in the planning process, but we will not be providing training on the tools. We will also provide updates on
lessons learned from assessing, planning, and implementing dozens of LTPBR projects across a wide variety of
geographic settings.
A LTPBR website is provided which includes more in-depth information including links to digital copies of a [low-tech
process-based restoration manual](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/) and [pocket guide](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/pocket), and many online lecture series which can be viewed either as
videos or pdf documents. We encourage workshop participants to review [Module 1](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1) online or read chapter 1 from the
[Low-tech Manual](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/) before the workshop. Digital copies of the manual and pocket guide are available
free of charge from the low-tech webpage.


### How to Get There
