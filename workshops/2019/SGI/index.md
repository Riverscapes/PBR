# LOW-TECH RIPARIAN RESTORATION - 2019 FIELD WORKSHOP SERIES

Thanks to the generous support of the [Natural Resources Conservation Service's](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=steldevb1027671) [Sage Grouse Initiative](https://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/) and [Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/plantsanimals/fishwildlife/?cid=stelprdb1046975), a grant through [Pheasants Forever](https://www.pheasantsforever.org/) to [Utah State University's Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu/) and [Joe Wheaton's](http://joewheaton.org/) [ET-AL](http://etal.joewheaton.org/) lab are able to deliver a series of workshops to NRCS conservationists and their partners throughout the west. This series was envisioned by Jeremy Maestas (NRCS/SGI) and is possible thanks to partner matches by various local organizations in each state (see each state page) and matching funds from Utah State University. This grew out of the successful 2016 [Enhancing Mesic Habitat Resilience in Sagebrush Ecosystems Workshop](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/2016---sgi-workshop.html) at Utah State University and the 2018 workshop series.

# Three Workshops

A series of workshops will be hosted in the summer of 2019 to connect local NRCS conservationists and partners in their states who are interested in how to use beaver, and beaver dam analogues as low-cost tools to restore riparian areas to benefit wildlife and working lands.

## Background

Through SGI 2.0, NRCS has committed to work with landowners and partners to help protect and restore mesic habitats, such as riparian and wet meadow areas, to benefit sage-grouse. While a variety of mesic conservation strategies exist, relatively simple and low-cost alternatives are a potentially important part of toolbox for restoration at scales relevant to sage-grouse.

Over the last decade, a renewed recognition of the role of the once widespread beaver has revealed insights about how this ecosystem engineer greatly impacts riparian function and accelerates recovery of degraded systems. Drawing upon lessons learned about how nature heals systems, Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) have emerged as a low-cost restoration tool designed to mimic beaver activity to restore hydrologic function and ecological processes in incised channels. BDAs are becoming an increasingly popular bioengineering technique employed by partners across the West and early results show promise for rapidly achieving a variety of riparian goals.
