### Construction - Day 3 - Station Creek 

**IMPORTANT**: Transportation will *not* be provided on Day 3 to Station Creek. To save time (and hopefully wrap up earlier, we will meet on site.

There is ample parking on site, but we should try and limit the number of vehicles. There is some cell reception.

[Station Creek](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/Projects/station.html) is a small, left-bank tributary to the Bear River just downstream of Oneida Narrows and about 15 minutes outside Preston, Idaho. We will be working on Terry and Wendy Westerberg's beautiful property for our design and construction exercises. See [here  for more background on Station Creek](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/Projects/station.html). For drivers, the road is dirt/gravel, but passenger vehicles are fine.

**NOTE**: For emergencies, [Franklin County Medical Center](https://goo.gl/maps/JwSKpEargiSLRPMA6) in Preston is the closest hospital to this field site @ 20 minutes away.

### Exploring Birch Creek - Day 3
By 14:00ish we will make our way over to the Birch Creek Trailhead (about 15 minutes away) to meet Jay Wilde and the [Capstone Restoration Class](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu).

<div class="responsive-embed">

We will then combine into a smaller number of four-wheel drive vehicles to make our way up through Jay's Ranch and on to the US Forest Service land up FS Road 1054 to the Mill Hollow, Birch Creek Confluence. If conditions are wet, it will require four wheel drive and clearance. It is about 10-15 minute drive.
