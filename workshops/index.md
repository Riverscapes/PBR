1. Semester-long graduate student course through Utah State University Department of Watershed Sciences (WATS 6860 - Check USU Registrar for offerings) 
2. Short courses & workshops open to public enrollment administered through Utah State University [Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) 
3. Custom short course for private audience (paid for by sponsor)
