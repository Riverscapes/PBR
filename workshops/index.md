# Can I make it Count?

Through our [USU Restoration Consoritum](http://restoration.usu.edu/) we do offer professional CEU credit hours as well as undergraduate and graduate matriculated student regular credit hours. 

## Graduate or Undergraduate University Credit
In the past, for the 2.5 day workshop, that was the equivalent of 1 matriculated semester credit (i.e. 15 contatct hours... with lab/field work counting @ 1/3) at [regular tuition](https://www.usu.edu/registrar/registration/payment/). The low-tech content has been oferred as both Espresso-Courses (short-courses) and Semseter Long as:
- [WATS 6900](https://catalog.usu.edu/content.php?filter%5B27%5D=WATS&filter%5B29%5D=6900&filter%5Bcourse_type%5D=-1&filter%5Bkeyword%5D=&filter%5B32%5D=1&filter%5Bcpage%5D=1&cur_cat_oid=12&expand=&navoid=3068&search_database=Filter#/usr/local/webroot/acalog-legacy/shared/htdocs_gateway/ajax/preview_course.php) - Graduate Special Topics
- [WATS 6860](https://catalog.usu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=12&coid=93002) - Partnering with Beaver in Restoration Design

We are currently restructuring these oferrings and in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 a revamped range of courses will be oferred. If you are interested in these courses, either check back to this website for information later, or we will post annoucements on the LTPBR List Serve (sbuscribe at left). All of these can be used to count toward our[Graduate Certificate Program in Restoration](http://restoration.usu.edu/programs/aquatic_ecosystem_restoration). 

## Professional Continuing Education Units
Our University offers professional continuing education units (CEUs) where 1 CEU = 10 contact hours).

With the  switch to this [3.5 day format with 5 modules](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/), we're restructuring that. We will be addingsome courses this Fall and Spring, which cover the same content as Virtual Workshop, but they will have some homework assignments and quizzes that will be assessed so that the credits are confirming some level of knowledge (as opposed to just participation). 

## Future Plans
All of these could be used to count toward our planned Professional Certificate Program in Restoration. We're also working with the Society of Ecological Restoration so that all these courses will count towards their [Certified Ecological Restoration Practitioner Program](https://www.ser.org/page/Certification).
