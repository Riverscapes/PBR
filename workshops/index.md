## Need Training?
We have worked hard through the [Utah State Univeresity Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) and with our many partners to deliver training to diverse audiences on low-tech process-based restoration. If you are looking for training for yourself or a small group, try our [publicly oferred courses](http://restoration.usu.edu/).  The next Low-Tech PBR Intro Workshop will be taught in Logan, Utah from October 9-11, 2019 and is set to follow the [Restoring the West Conference](https://restoringthewest.org/). For USU students, check the registrar's list of courses for current courses. If you want to develop a custom workshop for your own audiences, please [contact us](http://restoration.usu.edu/about/contact).

## Types of Training

<img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/workshops/teaching.jpg">We have taught over 25 workshops, short-courses and full semester long classes since 2010 on restoration.  There are four ways in which we have offered this training:
1. Semester-long courses through Utah State University Department of Watershed Sciences ([WATS 6860 - Partnering with Beaver in Restoration Design](http://beaver.joewheaton.org) and [WATS 5340 & 5350 - Capstone Restoraton Design](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu)) 
2. Short courses & workshops open to public enrollment administered through Utah State University [Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) and/or Geospatial Consortium 
3. Bespoke short courses & workshops open to public enrollment administered by other sponsor (e.g. [River Restoration Northwest](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/2013---rrnw-short-course.html))
4.  Custom short course for private audience  and paid for by sponsor (e.g. [NRCS]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshops/2019/SGI), [USFS](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/2015---usfs-workshop.html),  [UDWR](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/2015---udwr-workshop.html))

## Migration In Progress
Note that most of our past workshop pages for low-tech are hosted on the old [Partnering with Beaver in Restoration Design](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/) pages. We will be working on migrating that content to this site over the next 6 months. For now, for workshops from Spring of 2019 and prior, please refer to the old [Partnering with Beaver in Restoration Design](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/) pages.
