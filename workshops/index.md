## Formats

<img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/workshops/teaching.jpg">We have taught over 20 workshops, short-courses and full semester long classes since 2010 on low-tech process-based restoration (see table below).  There are a variety of ways in which we have offered this training:

- Short courses & workshops open to public enrollment administered through Utah State University [Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) 
- Custom short course for private audience (paid for by sponsor)- Free [Virtual Workshops]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshops/2020/SGI) and/or [Self-Paced Modules]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/Topics/)
- Semester-long graduate student course through Utah State University Department of Watershed Sciences (WATS 6860 - Check USU Registrar for offerings) 
- 
Note that Undergraduates in the [Department of Watershed Sciences](https://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/)  [Management and Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems](https://qcnr.usu.edu/undergraduates/prospective/degrees/aquatic_ecosystems) Major get a full year of training on low-tech process-based restoration in the [Capstone Classes (WATS 5340 & 5350)](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu).

## Workshops &  Short-Courses

--------------
### Utah State University Administered Workshops
In Spring 2021, we began offerring the modularized workshop curriculum (available for free, self-pacing [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/Topics/ )) in a sequence of five, short-courses. These short-courses differ from the workshop curriculum in that:
- These courses are taken for University Credit (for matriculated USU students) or University [Continuing Education Units](https://www.usu.edu/ais/ceu/about)
- These courses use the same curriculum, but are augmented by more in-depth class discussions, quizes and homework assignments
- These courses are assessed, and you will recieve feedback and a letter grade based on your assessed work.

Note that these courses meet weekly at specific times ([hybrid F2F](https://www.usu.edu/ais/scheduling/deliverymethods)), and the Design and Implementation have mandatory Saturday Field Trips.

# Can I make it Count?

Through our [USU Restoration Consoritum](http://restoration.usu.edu/) we do offer professional CEU credit hours as well as undergraduate and graduate matriculated student regular credit hours. To earn these credits, one needs to both pay the tuition and submit assignments, which are formally asssessed. By contrast, if you just want a Certificate of Participation (suffices for some professional development and training requirements), we issue these at participant request for all our workshops. 

## Graduate or Undergraduate University Credit
In the past, for the 2.5 day workshop, that was the equivalent of 1 matriculated semester credit (i.e. 15 contatct hours... with lab/field work counting @ 1/3) at [regular tuition](https://www.usu.edu/registrar/registration/payment/). The low-tech content has been oferred as both Espresso-Courses (short-courses) and Semseter Long as:
- [WATS 6900](https://catalog.usu.edu/content.php?filter%5B27%5D=WATS&filter%5B29%5D=6900&filter%5Bcourse_type%5D=-1&filter%5Bkeyword%5D=&filter%5B32%5D=1&filter%5Bcpage%5D=1&cur_cat_oid=12&expand=&navoid=3068&search_database=Filter#/usr/local/webroot/acalog-legacy/shared/htdocs_gateway/ajax/preview_course.php) - Graduate Special Topics
- [WATS 6860](https://catalog.usu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=12&coid=93002) - Partnering with Beaver in Restoration Design

From Spring 2021,  a revamped range of courses will be oferred (see above). All of these can be used to count toward our[Graduate Certificate Program in Restoration](http://restoration.usu.edu/programs/aquatic_ecosystem_restoration). 

## Professional Continuing Education Units
Our University offers professional continuing education units ([CEUs](https://www.usu.edu/ais/ceu/about)) where 1 CEU is roughly 10 contact hours).

With the  switch to this [3.5 day format with 5 modules](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/), we're restructuring that. We will be addingsome courses this Fall and Spring, which cover the same content as Virtual Workshop, but they will have some homework assignments and quizzes that will be assessed so that the credits are confirming some level of knowledge (as opposed to just participation). 

## Future Plans
We're also working with the Society of Ecological Restoration so that  these courses will count towards their [Certified Ecological Restoration Practitioner Program](https://www.ser.org/page/Certification).
