## Need Training?
We have worked hard through the [Utah State Univeresity Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) and with our many partners to delvier training to diverse audiences on low-tech process-based restoration. If you are looking for training for yourself or a small group, try our [publicly oferred courses](http://restoration.usu.edu/).  The next Low-Tech PBR Intro Workshop will be taught in Logan, Utah from October 9-11, 2019 and is set to follow the [Restoring the West Conference](https://restoringthewest.org/).

## Types of Workshops

<img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/workshops/teaching.jpg">We have taught over 25 workshops, short-courses and full semester long classes since 2010 on geomorphic change detection (see table below).  There are four ways in which we have offered this training:
1. Semester-long graduate student course through Utah State University Department of Watershed Sciences ([WATS 6850 & WATS 5150]({{ site.baseurl }}/Workshops/About/how-to-register)) 
2. Short courses & workshops open to [public enrollment]({{ site.baseurl }}/Workshops/About/how-to-register.html) administered through Utah State University [Restoration Consortium](http://restoration.usu.edu) and/or Geospatial Consortium 
3. Bespoke short courses & workshops open to public enrollment administered by other sponsor 
4.  Custom short course for private audience (paid for by sponsor)

## Migration In Progress
Note that most of our past workshop pages for low-tech are hosted on the old [Partnering with Beaver in Restoration Design](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/) pages. We will be working on migrating that content to this site over the next 6 months. For now, for workshops from Spring of 2019 and prior, please refer to the old [Partnering with Beaver in Restoration Design](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/) pages.
