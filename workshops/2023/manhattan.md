### **June 7 & 8 in Tepee Creek, WA**

-----
## Description
This field-based workshop will take place on Tepee Creek in the Klickitat River watershed and is intended to introduce conservationists to ‘low-tech’ process-based (LTPBR) approaches for restoring streams and their associated riparian areas (riverscapes) to benefit fish, wildlife, and Tribal lands. Participants will learn principles guiding low-tech process-based restoration and become familiar with simple, hand-built structures, including Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS), intended to mimic and promote specific ecosystem processes. The focus of the workshop will be on a set of guiding riverscape and restoration principles, design and construction of different low-tech structures, and the impairments the structures can treat. Planning, assessment, prioritization, and monitoring, though critical to restoration success, will not be covered in detail, but more in-depth information on all aspects of LTPBR restoration can be accessed throug the links below. 

We encourage workshop participants to review the lecture material before the workshop (especially <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1">Module 1</a>). The [Design Manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual), the [Pocket Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/pocket), and [online lecture series]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/Topics/) are all available online for review. If you only have an hour or so to review lecture materials, here are some recommendations: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnM52tj1BbI&t=234s">Scope of the Problem</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGmkIl6gVI">What Riverscapes Could Be</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4LogsoQEn0">Broad Umbrella of Low-Tech Restoration</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5gZQDEXlxQ&t=2s"> LTPBR Principles</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M__bF3zJjmM"> Reading Riverscapes: Mapping Valley Bottoms</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Tpxj60utpfs">Reading Riverscapes: Structural Forcing</a>.

## Course Materials


### Workshop Textbooks
For the workshops, we will rely on the new [Design Manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual) and the [Pocket Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/pocket), which are both available free digitally.   A hard copy of both will be provided to you in person at the workshop.  


### Workshop Lectures
Thanks to the generous support of the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s Working Lands for Wildlife, and a grant through Pheasants Forever to Utah State University’s Restoration Consortium and Joe Wheaton’s ET-AL lab are able to deliver a free virtual workshops to NRCS conservationists and their partners. This series was envisioned by Jeremy Maestas (NRCS) and is possible thanks to partner matches by various local organizations in each state and matching funds from Utah State University. This grew out of the successful 2016 Enhancing Mesic Habitat Resilience in Sagebrush Ecosystems Workshop at Utah State University and the 2018 and 2019 workshop series.

The latest iteration of these is a lecture series designed to be presented virtually over five days. The link below provides access to all the lectures on each aspect of low-tech PBR (e.g., planning and assessment, design, implementation)  in video and pdf format. These resources will provide more detailed information and links to scientific literature than can be delivered in field-based format.

### Yakama Nation – Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool
The Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) is a capacity model developed to assess the upper limits of riverscapes ability to support beaver dam-building activities. Both existing and historic capacity are estimated using readily available spatial datasets to evaluate five key lines of evidence: 1) a perennial water source, 2) availability of dam building materials, 3) ability to build a dam at baseflow, 4) likelihood of dams to withstand a typical flood, and 5) likelihood that stream gradient would limit or completely eliminate dam building by beaver.
BRAT was ran for all the perennial rivers and streams within the Yakama Nation Reservation, which includes portions of the Lower Yakima, and Klickitat watersheds. The analysis also included the Rock Creek, White Salmon, Little White Salmon, and Wind River watersheds. Click on the below link to access the data.
