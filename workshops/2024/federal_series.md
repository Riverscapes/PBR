# LTPBR Level 1 & 2 Series Trainings 

The USU Restoration Consortium has partnered with the NRCS and BLM to develop a standardized Level 1 & Level 2 training series for Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration. Students will receive 4.5 CEUs from USU and training accreditation through their employer upon completion of each series. 

## Level 1 Training Series 

In this training, students will learn the key principles and techniques for Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration. Students will 
- Study the key principles and techniques for Low-Tech Process Based Restoration. 
- Explore the scientific foundations of LTPBR and gain an understanding of the current state of LTPBR science
- Learn to assess current riverscape conditions & estimate recovery potential for effective LTPBR project planning
