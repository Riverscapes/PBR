# LTPBR Series Trainings - Federal Agencies 

The [USU Restoration Consortium](https://restoration.usu.edu) has partnered with the [Natural Resources Conservation Service National Techncial Training Center](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/continuing-education-information) and the [Bureau of Land Management's Aqutic Resources Program](https://www.blm.gov/programs/aquatics) to develop a standardized training series for Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration. These training series are pending incorporation into [AgLearn](https://aglearn.usda.gov/) and [DOI Talent](https://www.doi.gov/doitalent). Students will also receive continuing education units ([CEUs](https://cpe.usu.edu/contentManagement.do?method=load&code=PG0020)) and a transcript of professional credit from Utah State University. 

In Spring 2024, we will offer the LTPBR Level I and II trainings. Delivery of Level III is planned for Fall 2025.

## Level I Training Series 

In this training, students will learn the key principles and techniques for Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration. Students will 
- Study the key principles and techniques for Low-Tech Process Based Restoration. 
- Explore the scientific foundations of LTPBR and gain an understanding of the current state of LTPBR science
- Learn to assess current riverscape conditions & estimate recovery potential for effective LTPBR project planning

Students have completed the Level 1 training prior to taking the Level 2 courses and must register for all three courses to satisfy the Level 2 Series requirements. 

## Level II Training Series

Participants will engage in hands-on activities, from designing their own restoration projects to constructing low-tech structures and mastering adaptive management principles.
- Develop the skills to plan LTPBR restoration projects
- Construct & implement LTPBR strucures, learn about the permitting process and construction safety and logistics
- Learn how to build adaptive management plans and associated monitoring plans for LTPBR projects.

## Level III Training Series (Planned Fall 2025)

An advanced, Level III Training Series will be developed and will likely consist of the following short-courses:
- Advanced Planning of LTPBR Projects
- Advanced Design of LTPBR Projects
- Screening & Prioritization of LTPBR at Regional Scales
- LTPBR Action Effectiveness Monitoring

These advanced courses are targetted at practitioners within the agencies that are leading implementation efforts and attempting to scale up LTPBR practices to the scope of the problem in their watersheds and riverscapes.
