## Part 1 - Why are we workin in Pumpkin Creek?

<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Courses/WATS5350/2020/Week8_BirchCreekIntro_1.pdf"><img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lectures/2020-WATS5340_Week8_Part1.png"></a>
For WATS 5350, this video sets the stage for Birch Creek, the previous project with Jay Wilde upstream on USFS land, the motivation for that project, the results of that project and why there is trust to move down off the Forest and on to Jay's private, deeded property and continue with the project you will be planning, designing (and should be building if not for COVID-19, but can come and build in the summer if you want).

## Part 2 - Pumpkin  Creek Project Objectives & Conservation Planning Process

<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Courses/WATS5350/2020/Week8_BirchCreekIntro_2.pdf"><img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lectures/2020-WATS5350_Week8_Part2.png"></a>
This outlines the project reach, walks you through a fly through of the reach, lays out the restoration goals and objectives, and reminds you of the low-tech PBR [conservation planning process]({{ site.baseurl }}/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/planning.html) you will follow to get the project done. 

The video is about 35 minutes. Please post any questions you have to the [planning discussion board](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/567581/discussion_topics/1982817) in Canvas.

## Permitting

We cover permitting and the consultation process generically in [Module 5](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module5#c-consultation--permitting), but it is helpful to see real examples.  Here we provide drafts of specifically how the consultation and permitting process went for Pumpkin Creek.

### NEPA Compliance
All projects led by federal agencies have to comply with the [National Environmental Policy Act](https://www.doi.gov/nepa) - NEPA. For those of you directly involved in permitting and particularly permitting on projects with Federal Land Management Agencies, the NEPA is a crucial hurdle your federal partners are having to show compliance with. Whether you realize it or not, they are either working under an existing determination or having to arrive at a new one. Determinations of environmental impact of proposed actions are made as part of an environmental review under NEPA can involve three different levels of analysis:

- [Categorical Exclusion determination (CATEX)](https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process#CATEX)
- [Environmental Assessment/Finding of No Significant Impact (EA/FONSI)](https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process#ea)
- [Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)](https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process#EIS)

CATEX is simple and has been common for LTPBR projects of small scale.  If they go down the EA/FONSI or EIS route, you are talking a minimum of 1-2 year review and preparation period. The death sentence for project feasability is when this is engaged for every individual project. The alternative that some of our partners have pursued is to do larger, "programmatic" EAs that cover a broader body of work with greater geographic scope. Below are copies of the public comment versions of Alden Shalcross's (BLM Montana-Dakotas State Aquatics and Riparian Lead), which was developed for Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.

### Montana DNRC Joint Stream Permitting. 

Joint applications (jointly submitted to State and USACE) can be found at [Montana DNRC's Stream Permitting pages](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/cardd/conservation-districts/the-310-law). In states with a joint-application process (like Montana), one application package shown below can be prepared.

#### Army Corps Section 404 Compliance

In the [Omaha District](https://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory-Program.aspx), which covers most of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota draining to the Mississippi, we have seen some of the most cumbersome interpretation of permitting requirements under the Clean Water Act for LTPBR compared with other Districts (e.g. Sacramento, Walla Walla, Seattle, and Portland). Specifically, they have opted to require full, costly wetland delineations for each of these projects despite the existance of [Montana Natural Heritage's Wetland and Riparian Maps](https://mtnhp.org/nwi/) and the fact most of these projects seek to expand those wetlands, and most often not for mitigation purposes. This adds significant, unnecessary cost and time to the permitting process and is actively being negotiated with the Omaha District to reconsider its interpretation and stance.

On Pumpkin Creek, we were fortunate to have the expertise of  [Amy Chadwick](https://www.greatwesteng.com/team-member/amy-chadwick/) who prepared the [310 Joint Application Form](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/cardd/conservation-districts/the-310-law) and Wetland Delineations.
