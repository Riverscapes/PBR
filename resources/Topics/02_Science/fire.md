# Documentation of Beaver Increasing Resilience
Rick Lanman updated Wikpedia to include in the North American Beaver page, a section on [Â§ Beaver ponds as wildlife refugia and firebreaks in wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_beaver#Beaver_ponds_as_wildlife_refugia_and_firebreaks_in_wildfires).  In it

Although published in 1959, Eric describes his family's efforts in the 1920s and 1930s to mimic the work of beaver in British Columbia by repairing the abandon dams left behind from their extirpation in his watershed in the 1830s and 1840s. It is one of the earliest examples we know of, of what you might call beaver dam analogues (though he didn't give it a silly acronym).  Eventually, he is able to stop doing the maintenance when a game warden brings him a few translocated, live beaver to introduce to the area.

# Examples of LTPBR for Post Fire Recovery

### Baugh Creek, Idaho â†’ Sharps Fire 2018
<a target="blank" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ABigjKsC6SyBaaC48"><img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/covers/BaughCreekAlbum.png"></a>
The [Sharps Fire, 2018](https://www.fireweatheravalanche.org/wildfire/incident/50947/idaho/sharps-fire) was where the fairly obvious tweet below came from (i.e. "turns out water does not burn" - see [related Tweets <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i>
](https://twitter.com/i/events/1071556544725082112)). Intersetingly, on the heels of a NRCS [LTPBR Workshop](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/nrcs---idaho.html) in Hailey, Idaho, we were in discussions with [Idaho Fish and Game](https://idfg.idaho.gov/) about a potential LTPBR project to expand the footprint of beaver in Baugh Creek. Terry Gregory (IDFG) had for the previous two decades translocated live beaver from irrigation ditches up to Baugh Creek to do restoration work. Thanks to the efforts of Terry, the beaver he reintroduced, and their offspring we have the picture below (see [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ABigjKsC6SyBaaC48) for full album.

From [LCAN](https://www.idaholandcan.org/success/Restoring-streams-postfire-with-lowtech-structures-in-Idaho/3592/) - "Conservation professionals turned a negative into a positive in the aftermath of the 65,000-acre [Sharps wildfire]((https://www.fireweatheravalanche.org/wildfire/incident/50947/idaho/sharps-fire)) on Baugh Creek in the Little Wood watershed in Central Idaho. A major partnership project led by the Idaho Soil and Water Conservation Commission led to the installation of more than 120 beaver dam-type low-tech structures along Baugh Creek and two other tributaries to help restore the streams in a post-fire environment. The beaver dam analogs and other woody in-stream structures slow down the water flow, increase meanders and store water high in the watershed for the benefit of fish, wildlife and livestock.

The project was made possible by two private landowners in the area that wanted to restore the streams and improve wildlife habitat. Partners included [Idaho Fish and Game](https://idfg.idaho.gov/), [Trout Unlimited](https://www.tu.org/), [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service](), [Wood River Land Trust](https://woodriverlandtrust.org/), [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/idaho/placesweprotect/rock-creek-ranch.xml), [Anabranch Solutions](http://anabranchsolutions.com), [Utah State University](http://etal.joewheaton.org), and more."
