The idea that beaver dams can improve the resiliency of riverscapes to fire is common sense. That argument is made in [Module 1's Principles Lecture](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1.html#j-principles) (e.g. Slide 18 at right). This page highlights some of the examples, anecdotes, and the surprisingly [small amount (but convincing) of published scientific evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_beaver#Beaver_ponds_as_wildlife_refugia_and_firebreaks_in_wildfires) that give credence to this idea that ["It’s really not complicated: water doesn’t burn...”](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/09/beavers-firefighters-wildfires-california-oregon/).

This page highlights some of the resources on:

# Media Coverage
In recent years, there has been some media attention focused on the role that beaver can play in improving the resiliency of riverscapes to fire. This is perhaps best summed up in [Emily Fairfax's](https://emilyfairfaxscience.com/) stop-motion story:

# Documentation of Beaver Increasing Resilience

The documentation of beaver increasing resilience of riverscapes to fire exists in both popular literature and is starting to emerge in the scholarly literature. 

## Wikpedia
Rick Lanman updated Wikipedia to include in the North American Beaver page, a section on [§ Beaver ponds as wildlife refugia and firebreaks in wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_beaver#Beaver_ponds_as_wildlife_refugia_and_firebreaks_in_wildfires).  

## Popular Literature
<a target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Against-Wilderness-Classics-West/dp/1894898540"><img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/covers/3Against.jpg"></a>
[Three Against the Wilderness](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Against-Wilderness-Classics-West/dp/1894898540) - ​If you really want to convince yourself we're not on to anything new when it comes to partnering with beaver as a restoration tool, read Eric Collier's [Three Against the Wilderness](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Against-Wilderness-Classics-West/dp/1894898540).  Although published in 1959, Eric describes his family's efforts in the 1920s and 1930s to mimic the work of beaver in British Columbia by repairing the abandon dams left behind from their extirpation in his watershed in the 1830s and 1840s. It is one of the earliest examples we know of, of what you might call beaver dam analogues (though he didn't give it a silly acronym).  Eventually, he is able to stop doing the maintenance when a game warden brings him a few translocated, live beaver to introduce to the area.

# Potential Sources of Funding

There are numerous sources of funding for LTPBR, but to use as an emergency restoration tool post-fire, the following Federal programs (by agency) are good candidates:
- US Forest Service [BAER](https://www.fs.fed.us/naturalresources/watershed/burnedareas.shtml) (Burned Area Emergency Response) - *Known example(s): Nevada [Gance Fire - 2018](https://www.fireweatheravalanche.org/wildfire/incident/58652/nevada/gance-fire) and [South Sugarloaf Fire](https://www.fireweatheravalanche.org/wildfire/incident/55293/nevada/south-sugarloaf-fire)*
- Bureau of Land Management BARR
- USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service [EWPP](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/landscape/ewpp/) (Emergency Watershed Protection Program)

# Public Fire Information 
- [InciWeb](http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) - InciWeb is an interagency all-risk incident information management system.
- [Managing Wildland Fires](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/fire)
- [Fire Enterprise Geospatial Portal](https://egp.nwcg.gov/egp/) Fire Enterprise Geospatial Portal (EGP) is the authoritative source of standardized geospatial information for the full range of wildfire activities ranging from response to planning.
