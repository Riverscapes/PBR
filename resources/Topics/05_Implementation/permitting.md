In the 2020 Virtual Workshop, we cover the consultation process and permitting of [Module 5C (Consultation and Permitting)]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module5.html#c-consultation--permitting). Here we will post other permitting resources as they become available. 

## Utah LTPBR Permitting

The [Wild Utah Project](https://wildutahproject.org/stream-and-riparian-restoration)  recently hosted a webinar series with two helpful presentations from the Utah Division of Water Rights and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These webinars are essential for Utah's practitioners to ensure your project's planning and permitting is efficient and stays on schedule. Regulatory specialists teach why a permit is required and what information is needed to submit a complete permit application.
