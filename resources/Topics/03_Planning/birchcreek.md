#  Virtual Field Trip to Birch Creek

<img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/people/Wilde_round.png">
Normally, in our in-person workshops, we like to take participants in the field to see an actual low-tech process-based restoration (LTPBR) project on the ground. This helps you see first-hand a real riverscape subjected to "structural starvation"; and for which a LTPBR project was successfully completed. 

There is no substitute for meeting Jay Wilde in person and seeing what the beaver have done to [Birch Creek, Idaho](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/Projects/birch/) because of his efforts. Tromping around in the water and mud and experiencing this for yourself, really helps the concepts and the scope of what is possible sink in. This page attempts to reproduce as much of that experience as we can virtually for you in Birch Creek. 

## Topic Covered in WATS Classes
For those of you in the [WATS 5350 Capstone](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/) and/or the Fall 2020 [WATS 4950 Restoration Principles](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/595865), this is a substitute for part of the field trip we did on September 18, 2020. 

# Birch Creek Field Tour
## Guided Virtual Tour
In this 90 minute video, you are invited to a series of stops up and down Birch Creek. The conversation between Jay Wilde and Joe Wheaton is similar to the conversation we have when we take a whole class out.  Unlike the real field trip, where when you've had enough you can just hang back and wander around on your own, with this one you can fast forward if you get bored.

## Where is this?
We begin our virtual tour at the Birch Creek Trailhead  @ [7767 East Birch Creek Road, Preston, ID 83263](https://goo.gl/maps/BWc2nGndi6Fs1paZ6)) to meet Jay Wilde and the [Capstone Restoration Class](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu). We will then combine into a smaller number of four-wheel drive vehicles to make our way up through Jay's Ranch and on to the US Forest Service land up FS Road 1054 to the Mill Hollow, Birch Creek Confluence. If conditions are wet, it will require four wheel drive and clearance. It is about 10-15 minute drive.
