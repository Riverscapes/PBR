## Adaptive Management 

### What is adaptive management?
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289526568_Adapting_Adaptive_Management_for_Testing_the_Effectiveness_of_Stream_Restoration_An_Intensively_Monitored"><img class="float-left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pics/plan-amloop_1_orig.png"></a>Adaptive management is often referred to as 'learning by doing'. More fundamentally, adaptive management provides a pathway for proceeding forward with managing complex systems or projects in the face of uncertainty. The classic adaptive management loop consist of five components: 1) Planning, 2) Doing, 3) Evaluation, 4) Learning, and the option to 'Adjust' as needed. That 'adjustment' on the basis of evaluating what was done can lead to adjustment of conceptual models, adjustment of plans or adjustment of actions.

Adaptive management uses the formulation of a plan based on the best available information and articulation of a conceptual model of how the system works with predictions about how it should response to management actions.  One of the hallmarks of good adaptive management is that, multiple competing responses to management actions can be identified prior to actions (i.e. 'DO'ing). A decision/plan can be made on the basis of the predicted response, but if alternative, unforseen, or undeseriable outcome take place instead, management responses  can be identified ahead of time.  This allows competing concerns to be recognized, addressed and used to help craft the plan.

### Adaptive Management that is Pragmatic and Affordable

In Bouwes et al. (2016) we lay out our vision for how adaptive management can move beyond something only the biggest projects with the healthiest budgets can afford, to something we can and should as routine practice on almost every restoration project.

### Some Examples of Our Own Adaptive Mangement Plans
These are examples of simple adaptive management plans developed for low-tech restoration projects.
