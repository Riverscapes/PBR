This workshop will be held **July 18-19, 2023**. It will be a mix of field and classroom instruction. 


# Overview

This workshop was developed by NRCS Oregon, Pheasants Forever, Blue Forest Conservation, Lake County Umbrella Watershed Council, Intermountain West Joint Venture, and Anabranch Solutions and is intended to provide local landowners and the conservation community with the training, support, and guidance needed to implement process based restoration at landscape scales. There is funding available for landowners and managers to aid in these project and Pheasants Forever and Blue Forest are working to pilot a new system to further support the communities goals of sustainable agriculture and landscape resiliency. 


## Workshop Description
The workshop with introduce low-tech process-based approaches for restoring streams and their associated riparian and meadow ares (riverscapes) to benefit grass production, water reliability, sustainable working lands, fish and wildlife habitat. Participants will learn principles guiding low-tech process-based restoration and become familiar with simple, hand-built tools, including Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) and Post-Assisted Log Structures (PALS), intended to mimic and promote specific ecosystem processes. Participants will gain basic skills in the planning, design, and implementation phases of project development. Course content is supported by a published Design Manual. Instructio will be a mix of lectures, discussions, hands-on exercises at the desktop and in the field.

## Audience
The target audience for this workshop are local conservation professionals, agency staff, and landowners and managers.

### Field Gear
This is a hands-on workshop. For the field portions, we will be hiking and working on real construction projects. Your safety is our top priority, but you are the most important person in ensuring your safety and comfort. So bring common sense. Our workshop is in the Fall in the mountains. You should be prepared for anything from sunny skies and sunburn, to snow and hypothermia (yes weâ€™ve already had our first snow-storms, and yes we will work in the snow). We will be hiking through and doing work in small, wadeable streams. We **strongly recommend a pair of chest waders and wading boots**, in case the creek is flowing during the construction day. It is also possible we will be building structures in a hot, dry creek with isolated pools, so come prepared for a variety of weather.  You also should bring whatever outdoor clothing and gear to keep yourself comfortable. Layers, coats, gloves, hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a dry change of clothes for afterwards are all a must. For Day 2, no open-toed shoes will be allowed. Where work clothing suitable for a construction site.

We will provide you with basic personal protective equipment (PPEs like work gloves, eye protection, hard hats, ear protection).

If you have any allergies or medical conditions that we should be aware of, please notify your instructor.

### Meals, Snacks

- Day 1 (Classroom)
	- Morning coffee and snacks *provided* 
- Day 2 (Field Construction Day)
