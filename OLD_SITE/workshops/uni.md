In Fall 2025, we will be offering an advanced LTPBR course series for the first time. These courses are meant to be a continuation of your existing LTPBR training and are available to take individually or as a series. 

Participants will build on existing LTPBR planning, implementation, and monitoring skills. Practitioners will gain the advanced screening, planning, design, and monitoring skills to lead watershed and riverscape scope projects. 
- Advance the skills to plan LTPBR restoration projects
- Use Riverscapes Studio to prepare a design report and regulatory permit application
- Learn how to monitor and assess riverscape health
- Practice advanced geospatial analysis of riverscape network models to screen, filter, contextualize, and prioritize restoration actions
  
These courses fulfill graduate-level University Credit or University [Continuing Education Units](https://www.usu.edu/ais/ceu/about)

These courses are assessed, and you will receive feedback and a letter grade based on your assessed work.
