       			<li>Key phases of restoration project implementation include obtaining regulatory consultations and permits, construction, monitoring and adaptive management. Here, we highlight some specific considerations when implementing low-tech tools for process-based restoration.  </li>
       			<li>Application of beaver dam analogues (BDAs) and post-assisted log structures (PALS) as low-tech tools for process-based restoration is an emerging approach that may require working closely with local regulators to increase awareness of the practice and expected outcomes. Some recommendations are provided here on how to navigate the permitting process transparently and efficiently. </li>

              <ul>
       			<li>Unlike traditional restoration practice where construction is generally done by specialized contractors or heavy equipment operators, low-tech structures are often hand-crafted and can be built by a much broader range of people (e.g., from volunteers and conservation corps crews to professionals). This allows more people to participate in restoration, however, it involves additional safety and logistical considerations. Some best practices for managing low-tech construction process are provided.</li>
       			<li>Project monitoring and adaptive management is an essential part of low-tech restoration. ‘Letting the system do the work’ inherently means there will be surprises that we can learn from and adjustments that may be needed if desired objectives are not being met through time. We highlight some affordable and practical ways to implement adaptive management in low-tech process-based restoration.</li>
