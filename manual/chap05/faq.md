# Frequently Asked Questions about BDAs & PALS

## PALS & BDAs
### Do PALS and BDAs increase bank erosion and sediment delivery?

When BDAs breach there may be a temporary pulse in sediment as sediment stored behind the BDA is evacuated. Previous research is equivocal on whether or not the majority of sediment behind natural beaver dams is evacuated following breaching and blowout. More important is evaluating whether or not sediment delivery is increasing at the complex or reach scale. While individual BDAs by breach and/or force erosion locally, sediment that is mobilized is likely to be captured at downstream structures.  

### How many PALS/BDAs are required? 
The number of PALS or BDAs ‘required’ depends on the project objectives. When translocating beaver, it may be appropriate to build a limited amount number of total structures (e.g., 10) to create deep water habitat for successful translocation. Where the goal is increasing channel-floodplain connectivity, spacing structures such that flows can be forced overbank regularly will help determine how many structures are needed. When in doubt however, more is better. 


### What maintenance is required?
The maintenance required for BDAs  depends on annual flow events (stochastic ) and whether or not beaver are present. If beaver are present and maintaining BDAs (or alternatively building new dams) then little or no maintenance may be required. If beaver are not present, seasonal maintenance will likely be required to maintain ponding. Depending on the condition of the structure, maintenance can include adding additional posts, weaving woody vegetation and/or patching small gaps using cobbles and sediment.

### What are the minor risks associated with PALS and BDAs?
Material could move and be caught on infrastructure downstream (i..e, bridge or culvert); however, because these are generally small materials this is a problem that can be easily mitigated in most cases. Flooding of infrastructure is possible if floodplain is connected; a thorough review of the treatment reach should minimize these risks.

### What are the biggest risks associated with PALS and BDAs?
Overbuilding, poor expectation-management and wanting them to last forever .

## BDA-Specific
Do BDAs affect fish movement? 
Yes, but we worry about it too much. In general, native fish and beavers have coevolved and fish can migrate upstream and downstream of beaver dams during certain times of the year or during certain flow conditions. Previous studies have shown fish can traverse hundreds of BDAs and natural beaver dams (Bouwes et al., 2016a; Lokteff et al., 2013). 

### Do BDAs increase stream temperatures?
What is typically meant by this is “do beaver dams increase summer mean temperatures above lethal limits for certain biota (e.g., fish)?” The focus on the mean temperature is the wrong question and results from a number of studies on temperature impacts of beaver dams are inconclusive (Majerova et al., 2015) in terms of a consistent response (some mean temperatures increase, some decrease). What is remarkably consistent though in terms of temperature response is an increase in the spatial variability of temperature, and diurnal buffering of temperature swings. The spatial variability of temperature can increase by 3 to 10 C creating pockets of both much warmer and much cooler temperatures (Weber et al., 2017). The warm areas are typically associated with shallow ponded water areas, whereas the cool areas tend to occur downstream of dams and appear to be associated with the displacement and upwelling of cooler ground water from the increased hydraulic head upstream of the dam. The diversity of hydraulic pathways and residence time of water seems to make systems more resilient to thermal extremes by providing choices for biota (i.e. thermal refugia). 

### What happens if BDAs are breached?
BDAs are not intended to be permanent structures. Like beaver dams, BDAs may be breached during high flow events. The outcome of a breach depends on how the BDA is breached, the type of BDA and the local geomorphic setting. BDAs may breach in the center of the structure by overtopping or along the bank by endcuts. The type of breach therefore controls the local geomorphic response; overtopping can result in a scour pool below the structure, while endcuts promote bank erosion, channel widening and an increase in sinuosity.


### Does it matter where BDAs are located? 
Yes. Locally, the ability of a BDA to influence specific processes is determined by its location. A BDA in a highly incised channel is unlikely to promote floodplain connectivity. Conversely, a BDA located along a reach with an accessible floodplain can force overbank flow immediately. At broader spatial scales, BDAs are more likely to be able to address common restoration objectives within certain reach types. For example, BDAs located in steep, constricted headwater streams will have a limited ability to store water, promote riparian expansion, or increase channel and floodplain physical complexity.

### Are BDAs useful without beaver?
Yes. In areas where there are no beaver they can create immediate ponding for beaver translocation. Where beaver translocation is not feasible, BDAs can provide many of the benefits associated with natural beaver dams, including sediment retention, elevated water tables, increased floodplain connectivity and riparian expansion which may be required for future beaver translocation.

### Are willows necessary for BDAs?
No. BDAs can be built using any woody vegetation, including willow, cottonwood, juniper or sagebrush. Woody riparian species are necessary for forage, if beaver are being translocated. 

### Will BDAs work everywhere?
BDAs are designed to be implemented in areas that historically had beaver populations, and as such are generally located in partially confined or unconfined valley settings. These settings are characterized by medium to low hillslope connectivity and medium to high floodplain development. Similar to beaver (and this is a major consideration where beaver reintroduction is an objective) BDAs are designed to be implemented in areas that are conducive to their persistence. While they are not intended to be permanent structures they are designed to persist over timescales consistent with long-lived beaver dams (~ decades).

Therefore, highly confined, high gradient streams are not the intended setting for BDAs. Similarly, rivers with high annual peak flows, incapable of being dammed by beaver are not the intended setting for BDAs.

### Do BDAs address the causes of degradation? 
Much restoration literature emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of degradation. In a fluvial setting the causes of degradation can be local (e.g., channel straightening, levees, dams) or widespread (e.g., deforestation, urbanization, agriculture). Also degradation can be caused by actions that have both systemic and local effects such as the removal of riparian vegetation. In many cases, the initial causes of degradation constrain the processes that are essential for functioning riverine ecosystems, or may have moved the stream into an alternative stable state incapable of supporting important stream functions and processes.

Clearly BDAs do not address deforestation, dam building or the removal of riparian vegetation. However, in each of those cases, there are specific (often multiple ) affected that have resulted in the new condition. BDAs are intended to influence the processes initially affected by previous actions and create local and reach scale conditions that can restore processes that are critical to riverine health.

Where the removal of beaver is one of the causes of degradation, then BDAs do facilitate and/or mimic reversing the precise cause of degradation. Where riparian vegetation has been removed, channel incision has taken place, or channel straightening has occured (note that all three can be caused by multiple stressors), then BDAs can influence the hydraulic processes that were affected. Regarding riparian vegetation, BDAs can create the hydrological conditions (overbank flows, increased water table elevation) to recover the hydrology necessary to restoring riparian habitats. Regarding channel incision, BDAs promote channel aggradation and reconnection to the floodplain. Regarding channel straightening, BDAs can induce meanders and create and inset floodplain.

### How can the stability of BDAs be increased?
BDAs can be used across a diversity of settings, and as such will be subjected to different forces that affect the persistence of the structure. While breaching BDAs may still promote restoration goals, in other settings, BDAs may need to persist to achieve restoration objectives. Before choosing a method to increase the stability of BDAs, it is important to know the cause of failure. Where is the BDA located? Did the BDA experience breaching by being overtopped? Did scour undermine the base of the structure? If high flows have breached the structure by overtopping, then a lower dam crest height may allow flows over the dam rather than building up behind it resulting in a complete breach. Where scour has undermined the posts was it the result of headward erosion? Secondary dams used as grade control (where ponds reach the base of the primary dam) may increase primary dam stability. If the BDA is located in a confined setting where high flows cannot disperse, then perhaps the setting is inappropriate and/or the structure should be repurposed to initiate channel widening. In rivers with highly mobile substrate (sand-bedded rivers) using additional posts and more weave material may provide additional stability. Burlap sacks filled with sediment may also help prevent against scour at the base. 

### Can BDAs increase channel-floodplain connectivity?
Increasing channel-floodplain connectivity is often a goal of river restoration. We define connectivity as the ability of energy and materials to move between different areas on the landscape. In river restoration that often means water, sediment, nutrients and wood may move from the channel to the floodplain and vice-versa. Channel-floodplain connectivity therefore is controlled by the interaction of two factors: 1) channel geometry and 2) flow regime. Channel-floodplain connectivity can therefore by reduced by channel incision that prevents flows from being able to overtop banks, or by diminished flows from upstream flow regulations. 

BDA can be used to address both causes of decreased floodplain connectivity. BDAs cause aggradation that increases the elevation of the channel bed, reducing the vertical distance to the floodplain that can enable flows to reach floodplain during higher flow events. (The amount and rate of aggradation depends on local and watershed factors such as sediment supply. Also, depending on the magnitude of incision, channel-floodplain connectivity may take multiple years to re-establish.) By ponding water and adding roughness to the channel, BDAs also increase stage  during low and high flow events which increases the likelihood of overbank flows. In areas with limited incision, BDAs can be built to cause immediate floodplain connectivity.

What happens to the sediment captured by a BDA if there is a breach?
The amount of sediment evacuated by a dam breach depends on the local geomorphic setting and the nature of the breaching event. At the individual structure scale (~ 101 m), the amount of sediment evacuated will depend on the nature of the breach (endcut or mid-structure), the magnitude of the flow event, and local geomorphic factors like channel slope and confinement. Because BDAs are clustered into complexes, sediment evacuated from one BDA is not delivered from the reach unless all BDAs are breached in unison. Instead, sediment evacuated from one BDA will be stored behind downstream BDAs or on inset floodplain surfaces where flow is forced overbank by downstream BDAs. 

The existence of broad lowland alluvial valleys formed of fine sediment attributable to beavers, suggests that much sediment is retained even following the extirpation and/or removal of beaver. Previous studies have found variable rates of sediment evacuation following the breaching of beaver dams and suggested that local hydrologic and geomorphic controls determine the amount of sediment stored following breaching.
