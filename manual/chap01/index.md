	<li>Our over-arching goal is to improve the health of as many miles of riverscapes as possible and help those systems achieve and maintain their full potential in self-sustaining ways.</li>
	<li>Our intent is to help the restoration community maximize its efforts at promoting healthy ‘life-styles’ for as much of the full population of riverscapes as possible.  </li>
	<li>We identify ‘structural-starvation’ of wood and beaver dams from many riverscapes as one of the most common impairments to riverscape health, and one that low-tech restoration techniques can help improve. </li>
	<li>We intend for this manual to fill a void in the scientific literature and technical guidelines with respect to low-tech process-based restoration techniques.</li>
	<li>While process-based restoration concepts have been around for at least two decades, details and specific examples on how to implement such practices are lacking.</li>

        		<li>While many of the specific actions (e.g., building structures, reintroducing beaver) have been used in various forms for decades to centuries, the framework for how these actions fit together and what they are intended to achieve has not been effectively articulated. </li>
	<li>We do not attempt to provide a complete overview of process-based restoration, but instead point the reader to existing resources and address critical knowledge gaps where guidance can help push policy, regulations, practice and adaptive management forward.</li>
	<li>This manual does revisit many restoration topics (e.g., river health, condition & impairment assessment, restoration planning, design, construction and adaptive management) that have been covered elsewhere, but for which the application of those topics to low-tech process-based restoration needs clarification. </li>
	<li>Detailed design guidance is provided for two specific types of treatments that the authors helped pioneer the development and use of (beaver dam analogues and post-assisted log structures placed as high-density large woody debris).</li>
